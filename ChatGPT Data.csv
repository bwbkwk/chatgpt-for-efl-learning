"Today, PT Bank Maybank Indonesia, Tbk. (Maybank Indonesia) announced its consolidated financial results for the nine months until Sep. 30, 2022. It was revealed that Maybank Indonesia recorded Rp 1.48 trillion (US$95.24 million) in profits before tax (PBT) and profits after tax and minority interest (PATAMI) of Rp 1.06 trillion. Both PBT and PATAMI are therefore considered stable when compared with last year's results. While loans are showing growth, interest income has been reduced to lower loan yields as a result of rigid competition for loans. However, the Bank has also booked lower provisions as loan quality improved and well-contained overheads. The Bank’s net interest margin (NIM) also showed slight progression by 2 basis points (bps) to 4.8 percent in September 2022 due to lower costs of funds. The Bank’s fee-based income excluding global market fees was recorded at Rp1.23 trillion, attributed to loan and retail business-related fees and fees from subsidiaries. However, the Bank’s global market fees showed a 63.7 percent decline due to the global interest rate investment and volatile market conditions, with a decrease of total fee income by 10.4 percent year-on-year (yoy). Trade and business activities continued to show progressive trends throughout the nine months, followed by increasing demand for loans for large scale enterprises and corporations, as well as retail loans with the improvement in public consumption. These external factors resulted in a significant increase in the Bank’s total outstanding loans, which grew 12.8 percent to Rp 111.45 trillion from Rp 98.78 trillion last year. Maybank Indonesia’s banking segment grew exponentially by 25 percent from Rp 36.5 trillion to Rp 45.63 trillion to finance various projects and business expansions including in infrastructure, manufacturing and global trading. The Bank also grew in the community financial services (CFS) loan segment, comprising retail and non-retail segments, from Rp 62.29 trillion to Rp 65.81 trillion in the same period last year, showing a 5.7 percent growth. In non-retail loans for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), there was also another 5.7 percent growth from Rp 12.07 trillion to Rp 12.76 trillion. Meanwhile, the larger loan segment in SMEs also showed 1.3 percent growth from Rp 5.01 trillion to Rp 5.08 trillion as business and market activities resumed. In an effort to rebalance its non-retail loan portfolio segment, the Bank focused on loan disbursement to smaller segments, ensuring a more effective use of loans to support customers’ business continuity. Subsequently, the business banking loans portfolio experienced a 14.9 decrease that resulted in a 3.6 percent yoy decrease in the overall balance of the CFS non-retail loan segment. Meanwhile, the Bank’s consolidated CFS retail loan segment grew by 13.8 percent to Rp 37.74 trillion, backed by strengthening consumer purchasing power. The Bank’s credit card grew in business and personal loans by 12.5 percent to Rp 2.83 trillion. It was followed by subsidiaries' automotive financing of 20 percent (Rp 18.33 trillion). Mortgage loans have also shown growth from early 2022, showing an impressive 8.2 percent growth to Rp 16.03 trillion from the same period in the previous year. Total customer deposits grew 5 percent to Rp 107 trillion with current account saving account (CASA) growing 21.6 percent with current accounts increasing 33.9 percent to Rp 32.44 trillion and savings accounts increasing 7.6 percent to Rp 22.93 trillion. On the other hand, time deposits are observed to have declined 8.4 percent to Rp 51.63 trillion from Rp 56.34 trillion last year. This is due to the Bank’s consistent strategy to maintain low-cost funding through leveraging the Bank’s digital services to acquire customer deposits. Accordingly, the Bank’s CASA ratio improved and was higher at 51.8 percent in September 2022. With improvements in the overall economic outlook, the Bank recorded a decrease in provisions for impairment losses by 23.1 percent to Rp 818 billion in line with the Bank’s success in restructuring efforts for pandemic-impacted customers’ loans. The Bank’s consolidated non-performing loan (NPL) ratio improved to 3.5 percent (gross) and 2.5 percent (net) with a decrease in NPL balances by 16.3 percent yoy. The Bank maintained its prudent banking approach and conservative risk posture. Overhead costs remain under control at Rp 4.33 trillion even as businesses return to pre-pandemic normalcy. The Bank continues to implement sustainable cost management measures across its entire operations and initiatives to ensure every expense contributes to an increase in revenue. Liquidity remains strong with its bank-only loan to deposit ratio (LDR) at a healthy level of 90.2 percent, while its bank-only liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) stood at 176.9 percent in September 2022, exceeding the minimum level of 100 percent for regulators. Meanwhile, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) remained strong at 24.7 percent in September 2022, with a total capital of Rp 28.02 trillion. The Bank also showed considerable growth in digital platforms. Financial transactions through the Bank’s digital banking platform for retail customers, M2U, registered an increase in transactions of 24.8 percent to approximately 13.1 million. Meanwhile, the Bank’s digital platform for corporate customers, M2E, registered an increase in transactions of 32.2 percent to more than 3.1 million. In the third quarter of 2022, Maybank Indonesia announced that it will introduce various new features on M2U including real-time BI-FAST transfer and credit card add-on features, such as converting credit card transactions into installments and increasing credit card limits. Maybank Indonesia’s Syariah banking unit also grew in assets by 7 percent to Rp 39.67 trillion, contributing total assets to the Bank’s individual assets of 25.7 percent.  The segment’s financing also grew 12.8 percent to Rp 27.98 trillion while the CASA grew significantly by 37.3 percent to Rp12.40 trillion. “During the period, Maybank Indonesia focused on our growth strategies, which have contributed to the Bank’s profitability. We will remain disciplined in maintaining our liquidity and capital, while at the same time continue with our efforts to drive business growth by strengthening our productivity across the Bank’s key business segments, and our digital transformation to increase our operational and business agility, enabling us to navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead.” said president director of Maybank Indonesia, Taswin Zakaria. Meanwhile,  president commissioner of Maybank Indonesia, Dato Khairussaleh Ramli, has observed Maybank Indonesia’s resilience and ability to capture growth opportunities post-pandemic by booking strong loan growth in its key business segments for nine months in 2022. “Indonesia is a huge market with tremendous opportunities, and we see traction in our growth momentum. Given Indonesia’s potential, backed by the Bank’s strong fundamentals, and sound risk management, I am confident that Maybank Indonesia will be able to navigate through any potential market volatility it may experience in the coming quarters,” he added.","Maybank Indonesia recorded Rp 1.48tn ($95.24m) in PBT and Rp 1.06tn in PATAMI for the 9 months until Sep. 30, 2022, stable compared to last year.

"Coca-Cola is bringing back its Recycle Me program in collaboration with the Mahija Parahita Nusantara Foundation and Waste4Change. The program is part of Coca-Cola’s ambition to inspire change in Indonesia and increase the rate of plastic waste collection and recycling. From Oct. 30- Dec. 20, consumers of Coca-Cola’s product can now segregate, collect and send their PET plastic waste to collecting centers managed by Mahija Parahita Nusantara in Jakarta, Bekasi and Tangerang. By using the Waste4Change platform, recyclers will receive reward points, and the accumulated plastic waste will be processed into t-shirts, bags and other valuable products. Last year, the initiative successfully collected over 220 kilograms of plastic bottles from thousands of participants between October and December 2021. This year, Recycle Me will be providing a logistical subsidy up to Rp 30,000 (US$1.93) for the first 3,000 users. Reward points can also be used to redeem various utility tokens including phone credit, electricity tokens and an e-wallet with a maximum worth of Rp 25,000 at various merchants. “Companies like Coca-Cola can play an important role in using the power and reach of their brand to drive consumer awareness of recycling and help inspire behavior change. We are confident that this year's Recycle Me program will have a far greater impact on reducing plastic waste in Indonesia,"" said managing director of Waste4Change, Mohamad Bijaksana Junerosano. Furthermore, the initiative is also an attempt to create a closed-loop production for PET bottles in Indonesia. For this program, Coca-Cola is utilizing a recycled PET (rPET) plant operating under Coca-Cola Europacific Partners in collaboration with Dynapack Asia and Amandina Bumi Nusantara. In 2022, the Amandina plant has the capacity to process 15,000 tonnes of waste/year with an aim to increase production up to 25,000 tonnes of waste/year in 2023.

Over the years, the foundation has contributed to the welfare of pemulung families through programs such as free health checkups and donations in the form of basic needs. “We believe that informal waste collectors play an important role in the local economy and contribute significantly to increasing the rate of PET plastic bottle collection in Indonesia,” added Karina. Involving customers and making them aware of the importance of the process of collecting and recycling used packaging is also part of Coca-Cola’s vision to create a World Without Waste --one of which is realized through achieving its zero-waste target by 2030. “By doing the Recycle Me again in its second year, we are once again raising awareness and provide an incentive for our customers to sort their used bottles.

"The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the SDG Academy Indonesia today kicked off a series of nationwide training programs on the circular economy, a zero-waste model that can support Indonesia to accelerate green growth and meet its ambitious emission targets. The Indonesian government has prioritized the implementation of circular economy in the country. The economic model requires manufacturers and companies to reduce material consumption, waste and emissions while at the same time sustaining growth. Today’s training program was held in partnership with Japanese manufacturing company, Nippon Closures Co., Ltd (NCC) and corporate innovation-accelerator Intellectual Capital Management Group Pte., Ltd (ICMG). The training makes up part of a five-month SDG Leadership Program on the circular economy, which began with five dialogues on the topic. The online dialogues involved experts with best examples from the two countries who provided the current picture on the implementation of the circular economy in Japan and Indonesia. UNDP Indonesia resident representative Mr. Norimasa Shimomura, ambassador of Japan to Indonesia Mr. Kanasugi Kenji, representatives from the Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry (METI), representatives from the Planning and National Development Ministry (Bappenas), global CEO Tanoto Foundation, Directorate of Environment from Bappenas, as well as NCC and ICMG focal points attended the opening event. Mr. Shimomura emphasized the significance of the circular economy to Indonesia's goal of inclusive and green economic growth. “The circular economy is more than just running a waste-management system. It requires awareness, change in individual behaviours, science and technology, business models and financing models, among other factors. With these in place, it will enable Indonesia's economy and society to become greener, resilient and inclusive,"" he said. The circular economy training program will target government and non-government officials including academia, the private sector, philanthropic organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), media and youth. Aside from the training programs, UNDP has also been working in partnership with the government of Indonesia to mainstream circular economy in the national-development plan. With support from the government of Denmark, Bappenas and UNDP last August launched a book titled The Future is Circular: Concrete Steps for Circular Economic Initiatives in Indonesia.

"PT Supra Boga Lestari Tbk. has a massive presence in the Indonesian market, offering a wide variety of fresh produce and an extensive selection of quality imported products. The company is now entering its 24th year with a big celebration to show its appreciation of its customers. Supported by Blibli as its official e-commerce partner, the anniversary event is being held in Senayan Park, from Oct. 10 to 23. Also involved in the event are the six brands of PT. Supra Boga Lestari Tbk.; Ranch Market, The Gourmet, Pasarina, Farmers Market, Farmers Family and Day2Day. The opening ceremony on Wednesday was held in conjunction with the company’s 24th anniversary, as it transformed the two floors of Senayan Park into six “islands” representing each of the aforementioned brands, decorated individually for the visitor experience. The “Famous Markets Around the World” attraction draws inspiration from Pike Place Market in Seattle for the Rank Market area, and an intersection of Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar and Chelsea Market of New York City for The Gourmet area. The Pasarina area is influenced by Pasar Triwindu in Solo, and Farmers Market by Pasar Kumandang in Wonosobo. On the other side of the area, Day2Day’s decoration is inspired by the lifestyle of the younger generation, while Farmers Family is set to attract younger families. “This 24th anniversary is very special for us. We wanted to create a new movement and present something different from before, and so the idea of Market Hopping was born. The concept of hopping from market to market allows visitors to get to know our brand more closely. In addition, the varied characteristics of each brand at the same time show how our supermarket is ready to serve every level of society,” said Meshvara Kanjaya, CEO of PT. Supra Boga Lestari Tbk. He explained that the goal of the event is to show the different varieties of each brand that are tailored to all the different markets in Indonesia, and it shows how the company strives to improve its service with the changing times and lifestyle trends.

"With the acceleration of digitalization in recent years, the topic of digital literacy has taken center stage, as fear looms that members of various communities might not be able to keep up with the transformation. Spreading information via internet penetration plays a powerful role in society, but there is a lag in awareness about how to identify misleading information, especially on the internet. ASEAN is not blind to the issue, and has amassed powerful voices to increase digital penetration and combat misinformation. ASEAN Foundation, with support from the United States Mission to ASEAN and Google.org, proudly officiated today 20 members of the ASEAN Youth Advisory Group (ASEAN YAG) who will lead an awareness-raising campaign to combat misinformation and disinformation across ASEAN. The inauguration was held in Jakarta on Friday (7/10/2022). “These 20 young changemakers will stand at the forefront of our efforts in strengthening the digital literacy skills of ASEAN citizens, transforming them into agents of change that can combat online misinformation and disinformation,” said Dr. Yang Mee Eng, executive director of ASEAN Foundation, at the momentous event. The members were chosen from hundreds of candidates hailing from various ASEAN countries to become the voice to bridge the gap between grassroot communities and the international platform to raise awareness of the importance of digital literacy in their communities through a creative, and, most importantly, localized approach. This event is an important one for Indonesia, as the country begins the position of chairmanship of ASEAN for 2023. Faransina Olivia Rumere and Nissi Taruli Felicia were chosen as the two representatives from Indonesia, with both having prior experiences working with deaf and marginalized people in the country. Before carrying out their role as members of ASEAN YAG, they will receive a series of capacity building that will equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills to conduct successful campaigns. The inauguration marked an important milestone for ASEAN Digital Literacy Programme (ASEAN DLP), a 2-year regional initiative that aims to build stronger digital literacy among the people. With the support of a US$1.5 million grant from Google.org, ASEAN DLP will lead the implementation of the program, equipping more than 1,000 trainers across 10 member countries with media and information-literacy skills who will in turn train 100,000 beneficiaries in local communities. “We are proud to support the ASEAN Foundation in empowering people across the region with crucial media-literacy skills that will be key in enabling them to remain vigilant as they navigate an increasingly online world. There is no doubt that the youth leaders and changemakers appointed today will play a pivotal role in reaching deep within their communities to leverage various technologies and empower themselves, as well as those around them, to tackle misinformation. We are looking forward to the strides that this initiative will bring in creating a safer digital space within the ASEAN region,” said Marija Ralic, lead for Google.org APAC.    “This is a world-class program.  Through the campaigns this Youth Advisory Group creates and the education, training and digital upskilling provided by the ASEAN Foundation and supported by Google.org, more than 100,000 people of all ages and experience levels over the next two years will be given the tools and knowledge they need to fight back against misinformation. This partnership, which was announced at the May US-ASEAN Special Summit, is yet another example of the commitment of the American people to Southeast Asia,” said US ambassador to ASEAN, Yohannes Abraham. The event was also attended by 30 key stakeholders in the region, including 15 partners that will help make ASEAN DLP a success based on prior experiences of working with vulnerable communities. Attendees were able to hear speeches from ASEAN foundation and the US Mission to ASEAN, followed by a talk show about the power of information, the trend on disinformation today and how to become a smart digital citizen. The panel was made up of Arianne Santoso from Google Indonesia, crowned Miss International Indonesia 2022 Cindy May McGuire and Nissi Taruli Felicia as representative from the ASEAN YAG.","The ASEAN Foundation, with support from the US Mission to ASEAN and Google.org, has inaugurated 20 members of the ASEAN Youth Advisory Group (ASEAN YAG) to lead an awareness-raising campaign to combat misinformation and disinformation in the ASEAN region.

"Leading global agriculture company Syngenta has launched the CENTRIGO™ Farming Ecosystem. An important milestone in Syngenta’s continuous effort to support farmers in Indonesia, CENTRIGO™ places the farmer at the center of a digitally enabled farming ecosystem,  offering integrated, end-to-end solutions that overcome the barriers to higher productivity and profitability. With the population growing across Asia, food safety and security are a concern across the region and within Indonesia. Ensuring that the daily work of farmers is productive and profitable is key for optimal food production in the country. However, the climactic and market forces that affect their business pose challenges to growing and getting the right value for their produce, which also directly affects their income.  At present, little of the profits made in the food production chain stay in the hands of farmers. Based on the February 2022 Income Statistics from Statistics Indonesia (BPS), casual workers in agriculture have the lowest net income of all industries. A major factor in this finding is that farmers are often underserved and lack access to basic technologies that can unlock the full potential and value of their farms and produce. To better support farmers in overcoming these challenges, CENTRIGO™ Farming Ecosystem was launched earlier this week in Java, welcomed with great enthusiasm by farmers and stakeholders. The first launch was in Lembang, a major vegetable-growing region in West Java, on Oct. 4; and the second in Kediri, East Java, on Oct. 6, where the focus will be in corn production. “We are expanding our offering to farmers beyond our industry-leading crop protection and seed solutions, thinking more holistically about what farmers need day to day, to enable them to grow their crops. This is what CENTRIGO™ brings to the table, through its centers, digital approach, services and integrated solutions,” said Kazim Hasnain, president director of PT Syngenta Indonesia. “CENTRIGO™ is backed by partners who are the best at what they do and will ensure that farmers receive the most value from our CENTRIGO™ SmartAg program”, said Andre Oliveira, new farming ecosystem head, Asia Pacific. Under the program, farmers will first receive planning advice from the CENTRIGO™ team, followed by micro-credit and banking services from Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). Farmers will be provided with access to high-quality vegetable seedlings and NK corn seed, and leading crop protection technology from Syngenta. Yara will provide soil testing for customized nutrition advice and fertilizer solutions. Meanwhile, Sayurbox and JIVA will act as offtake players for vegetables and corn respectively. With support from CENTRIGO™, farmers can fulfill their key role in ensuring better food security while also maximizing their overall income. The company is committed to expanding collaboration with other partners to broaden the offering in support of farmers’ needs. “Equipped with a network of knowledge and services, we are confident that CENTRIGO™ farmers will be the entrepreneurs to lead the way in modernizing agriculture.”","Syngenta has launched CENTRIGO™ Farming Ecosystem, a digital platform that provides integrated solutions to support farmers in Indonesia.

In a speech, President Jokowi reminded the audience that the world economy was facing food, energy and financial crises. He then emphasized the importance of cooperation with one another. “We need to be cooperative. That’s why we need Indonesia to be an incorporated body. Businesses big, small and micro must collaborate to tackle problems in a concrete and real way. By banding together, large, medium and small businesses can be a formidable force,” said the President.

During the event, the President took the time to meet with micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) owners, including Sampoerna Retail Community (SRC) members. With more than 165,000 retailers across the country as members, SRC is part of PT HM Sampoerna Tbk. (Sampoerna)’s commitment to support Indonesian MSMEs. Strengthening collaboration Meanwhile, Kadin chair Arsjad Rasjid said the Inclusive Partnership Movement to upscale MSMEs was part of Kadin’s plan to gather stakeholders from both the government and private sector – from large corporations to MSMEs – to strengthen industry collaboration in Indonesia. He hoped that the program would improve the welfare of other actors along the value chain, including farmers and the MSMEs themselves. The program will encompass assistance in farming and market access, increasing productivity and income and maintaining the stability of supply and pricing. “Kadin believes that the government and the private sector play a crucial role in enabling MSMEs to reach their full potential. This will be the first step in demonstrating how an inclusive partnership should be a vital part of MSMEs, including farmers and fishermen,” Arsjad said. Kadin also previously launched the Wikiwirausaha digital platform to connect MSMEs with larger businesses in accordance with their needs for technological assistance, funding, export access and more. President Widodo accompanied by the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto visiting the Sampoerna Retail Community (SRC) booth at the Inclusive Partnership Movement for Leveling up MSMEs event and discussion at SMESCO Indonesia on Monday. The President, in his speech, stated that to assist MSMEs, farmers, and fishermen, there needs to be private corporations and partnership initiatives as done by Kadin to make a synergy succeed. ","Indonesian President Joko Widodo inaugurated the Inclusive Partnership Movement, initiated by the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN) to strengthen collaboration between government, private sector, and MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises). The President emphasized the importance of cooperation and community empowerment for businesses of all sizes, and said that the world economy is facing food, energy, and financial crises. KADIN Chair Arsjad Rasjid said the program will include assistance in farming and market access, increased productivity and income, and stability of supply and pricing, with the goal of improving the welfare of MSMEs, farmers, and fishermen.

"The Indonesia Energy and Engineering (IEE) 2022 Series held at the Jakarta International Expo in Kemayoran, Central Jakarta has ended, with energy and digitalization taking the center stage. Sidarto Danusubroto, a member of the President’s Advisory Board, explained that Indonesian economic growth was inseparable from the government’s support of digitalization and investment, including in the energy and mining sectors. He gave the example of 5G Smart Mining that Indonesia had just adopted in the country’s eastern region – the first in Southeast Asia. “What does it mean? It means that efforts to use digitalization in the working process in energy, construction and infrastructure, especially on the operation side, remain open, and the government is proud of the active role that Indonesian citizens with expertise in the field have taken,” he said. He also reaffirmed the government’s human resources development as a national development strategy in order to accelerate economic growth, and support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) program. The opening of the IEE 2022 Series was attended by the Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Ministry's maritime security and resilience assistant deputy, Basilio Dias Araujo. He said that the energy sector also required quality manpower that was able to adopt digital technology. “The energy sector is one of Indonesia’s largest [sources of] wealth, in which processes should be efficient. Several efforts can be made including scaling up the workforce’s capabilities and [increasing the use of] digital technology considering that up to now, the utilization of renewable energy only reaches 5 percent of the targeted 30 percent by 2045,” he said. Basilio emphasized the crucial role that renewable energy and digitalization played in the energy sector, especially in accelerating Indonesia’s green-energy transformation toward zero carbon emissions in 2060 and underpin the implementation of SDG programs related to achieving energy security as planned. He expressed his appreciation for the role the exhibition played in orchestrating all players of energy and technical industries to support the government’s endeavors to implement 11 of the 17 SDG programs, either through renewable energy, economic growth, technology innovations and infrastructure, collaboration opportunities or investment. The IEE 2022 Series, organized by leading event organizer PT Pamerindo Indonesia, was held from Sept. 14 to 17. Dubbed the largest exhibition in Southeast Asia, the IEE 2022 Series was a blend of five international-scale displays of a range of essential sectors in Indonesia, comprising Electric and Power Indonesia, Oil and Gas Indonesia, Mining Indonesia, Construction Indonesia and Concrete Show Southeast Asia. Following two years of organizing online exhibitions, this year the IEE 2022 Series was held in a hybrid mode to accommodate the interests of visitors, allowing them to attend onsite or online. The event allowed stakeholders to meet directly and witness the innovations and technology that had been developed in a real way. The IEE 2022 Series attracted more than 1,100 participating exhibitors from 42 countries or regions and 2,700 products and services that prioritize renewable energy, sustainability and the empowerment of young talent, with a range of technological innovations in energy and the technical area. The event constituted Pamerindo’s steps to support an investment-friendly climate in a bid to propel economic growth in Indonesia. Pamerindo IEE Series event director Lia Indriasari is optimistic that the IEE 2022 Series, with its spirit of “back to market” provided concrete evidence of the industry’s development of the energy and technical sector. “The exhibition served as a platform for a multiplier effect, especially in the economic sector such as the foreign exchange earnings, export-import ad investment climate,” she said. She went on to say that support from all industry players was needed to shore up Indonesian economic growth against various issues. Data from Statistics Indonesia show Indonesian economic growth was recorded at 5.44 percent in the second quarter of 2022, of which 4.01 percent was contributed by the mining sector and 1.02 percent by the construction sector. It is undeniable that this growth was experienced in parallel with the rising trend in the digitalization of industry, with the government playing a crucial role in supporting the acceleration of various sectors. Lia Indriasari added that all aspects of the exhibition were harmonized with sustainability programs as a show of Pamerindo’s commitment to the people, the government, industry and the environment. “I am proud because holding the IEE 2022 Series has also led to the implementation of 11 SDG programs that support Indonesia in achieving its vision of becoming an advanced country by 2045 and included in the world’s five economic power with the superior human resources,” he said. At the opening of the IEE 2022 Series, Pamerindo also launched its new program GIFA and METEC 2023, in collaboration with Singapore’s Messe Düsseldorf Asia (MDA), which will hold the event Metallurgy and Casting in Indonesia 2023. To support innovation and superior human resources, the event will include a variety of features such business meetings, product presentations via podcasts and live reports from the show floor. On top of that, the event will also provide artificial intelligence (AI) supported applications that visitors will be able to use and also feature more than 20 seminars to be held in a hybrid mode, with 40 highly experienced speakers from a range of fields.","The Indonesia Energy and Engineering (IEE) 2022 Series has ended in Jakarta, with the focus on energy and digitalization.

"Sharing happiness – a desire which, it is safe to say, comes from care and compassion. As Christopher McCandless once said, ""Happiness is only real when shared."" As a solo adventurer, Christopher realized that happiness feels more glorious when shared with other humans. This philosophy was also embedded in Fujifilm Indonesia (FFID) when it celebrated its 11th anniversary. ""It doesn't feel right, as we grow, if we don’t share our happiness with people around us,” said FFID Corporate Affairs general manager Rudy Handojo. FFID's choice to share its happiness this year was to visit Kuntum Teratai Orphanage Orphanage, located in the Bukit Duri area of Tebet, South Jakarta. “This visit to the orphanage not only fosters a sense of love in us but also serves as a reminder to stay grounded. I am happy to see the children happy,” said FFID president director Masato Yamamoto. Indeed, the children at Kuntum Teratai Orphanage looked very happy. They sang together as the FFID team entered their home. This visit became even more special because two children who live in the orphanage also had their birthdays that day. They were Bunga and Azzizah. Bunga was celebrating her 10th birthday while Azzizah her 11th birthday. Slightly embarrassed, like all children of their age, they came forward to blow out the birthday cake candles. ""Let them blow the candles off, at once representing Fujifilm,"" said Masato. While Bunga and Azzizah blew out the candles, it would have been a shame if that beautiful moment was not captured. Many digital cameras and cell phone cameras started taking their photos.  The happiness hidden behind their shy faces was now immortalized. Bunga and Azzizah blow out the birthday cake candles. (Dok. FFID/.) The happiness they felt was also shared by the other children. As shown by the smile that spread on the face of Kiki Ramadhan (12). Kiki and his friends, fellow foster children at Kuntum Teratai Orphanage, were engrossed while looking a small camera brought by the FFID team, which was then given to an orphanage administrator. Together with dozens of his friends, Kiki looked straight at the camera with a smile on his face, a wide laugh tugging at his mouth, but with a little look of confusion. Drowned in many feelings, he heard a voice say, ""Look at the camera... One... Two... Three..."" shouted by the orphanage administrator holding the camera, while pressing the button. In just seconds, a sheet of photographic paper emerged from the camera – this was an instant camera, which can take pictures and immediately print the results. The printed photo revealed a picture of Kiki and the other children smiling broadly. ""I'm happy, the photos can be done immediately. I have never seen a camera like this,” said the boy who had lived in the orphanage since he was 4 years old. Now, the reason why there was a little confused look on his face had already been answered. Kiki has never seen an instant camera like this before. He thought earlier when he first saw the camera, ""is it a toy?"" Kiki, who was born in 2010, said he was amazed to see a camera that could take pictures and immediately print them. As part of Generation Z, Kiki has never interacted with analog cameras before. Since he was born, digital tools had colored his days, from smartphones with cameras and LCD televisions to digital music players. For Kiki, this instant camera provided its own entertainment. With the ability to print photos, it is able to enliven the atmosphere when Kiki gathers with his friends, who he considers his own family. “I want to take pictures of all my friends with this camera,” he said with a smile. Hearing Kiki's words, Rudy then explained, “The printed photos are for them. As a remembrance that they once shared happiness with us for an afternoon.” Kuntum Teratai Orphanage Foundation’s chairwoman, Nina Agustina, conveyed the same sense of happiness during the 2022 Fujifilm CSR activity with the theme Don't Just Take, Give, on Sept. 5. According to her, the activity, which was held in commemoration of Fujifilm's 11th anniversary, brought happiness to all residents of the orphanage, including through the presence of instant cameras. According to Nina, instant cameras feel foreign to most children today. However, they raise the children’s interest and curiosity to use the camera. ""Kids feel this is foreign but curious, their curiosity increases, so they want to find out more about the camera,"" she said. But for Nina herself, who founded Kuntum Teratai Orphanage in 2004, the existence of a camera that can print photos evokes old memories of childhood. When a sheet of photo paper can be kept and can be enjoyed again at a later time, Nina said she felt close to the memory itself. “It’s great that there is a photo paper that can be enjoyed, can be kept and can be viewed again at another time to evoke memories,” said Nina. The FFID team with the children of Kuntum Teratai Orphanage hold up their photos taken by an Instax Camera. (Dok. FFID/.) This small instant camera has been around since 1998. Since then, the camera, known as the Instax Camera, has continued to innovate. As Consumer Printing (Instax) marketing manager Rena Ratna Sari said, “Instax camera continues to grow by presenting the latest products. Adapting to the latest technological innovations and of course adjusting to the trends of young people.” What Rena said rings true, that Instax cameras adapt to the trends of young people. Kiki and his friends have also entered this youth group. There is no doubt that the Instax camera has brightened up the atmosphere at the orphanage, making Kiki and his friends' day even more fun. Indeed, it is a hope that Instax camera users not only capture the moment but can also share them with other people or family and closest relatives. ""Just like sharing happiness, people will be happy to receive personal gifts like their photos,"" said Rena. With all the features that the Instax camera has, it is a pleasure to use it on any occasion. Like Kiki and his friends at Kuntum Teratai Orphanage, who always have a smile on their faces. When they press the photo button and get their printed photo instantly, that is when they create beautiful memories that will last a lifetime. “Happy 11th anniversary Fujifilm Indonesia. Thank you for sharing with us on this special day,” said Kiki and his friends.","Fujifilm Indonesia (FFID) celebrated its 11th anniversary by sharing happiness with the children at Kuntum Teratai Orphanage in South Jakarta.

"The Amadeus Symphony Orchestra Foundation has reached its 30th year of promoting classical music education in Indonesia. The foundation celebrated the milestone with a performance titled “Seaside to Countryside” on Thursday. Under the direction of Henrik Hochschild, associate concertmaster at the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the orchestra played works by Mendelssohn, Weber, Bruch and Beethoven. The concert features clarinet soloist Nino Ario Wijaya and viola soloist Noah Joseph Wimandjaja. The program consisted of: The Hebrides Overture by Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy; Concertino for Clarinet and Orchestra in E Flat Major, Op. 26 by Carl Maria von Weber performed by clarinet soloist Nino Ario Wijaya; Romance for Viola and Orchestra, Op. 85 by Max Brunch performed by viola soloist Noah Joseph Wimandjaja and Symphony No.6 and Pastorale by Ludwig van Beethoven. The concert, which was held at the Usmar Ismail Hall, was made livelier with the attendance of 30 students from the Secondary School of Music from Cibinong. The Amadeus Symphony Orchestra Foundation also received congratulations from prolific guests, such as musician Kevin Aprilio, Jakarta Concert Orchestra founder Avip Priatna and renowned scholar Franz Magnis-Suseno. The Amadeus Symphony Orchestra foundation has an impressive track record in developing classical music education in Indonesia. Back in 1992, Grace Soedargo founded the Amadeus Music School (SMA) with the support of the foundation. Since then, the SMA has trained thousands of students of various ages from as young as age two. Now, it has over 200 disciples in piano, strings, wind and percussion instruments. With a team of 25 teachers, the SMA continues to teach classical music in the classroom as well as student orchestras and its ensembles. In the “Seaside to Countryside” concert for example, Grace played an instrument together with other teachers and students —the youngest being eleven. “Early music education is important for children due to its holistic nature; it promotes the development of intellectual, emotional and motor skills while also instilling discipline, self-control and teamwork abilities,” said Grace. “Being a music teacher is actually more challenging in that we need to master the skills handed down from generation to generation in their areas of origin. For example, we need to follow European traditions in classical music and Indonesian traditions when we teach ethnic music,” she added. The SMA is the only music school in Southeast Asia to be affiliated with the Johann Sebastian Bach Musikschule (JBSM) in Vienna, Austria. Viola Soloist Noah Joseph Wimandjaja, for example, is the first Indonesian to be accepted into the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna in the JBSM gifted class.","The Amadeus Symphony Orchestra Foundation celebrated its 30th year of promoting classical music education in Indonesia with a performance titled ""Seaside to Countryside"".

"Following the success of last year’s Art Jakarta Gardens, the second event has been set for April, at Hutan Kota by Plataran. The eight-day event will open on Feb. 7, 2023. While the first day will be reserved for VIP guests, it will be available for the public starting on the second day. “It is an honor that Art Jakarta Gardens receives heartwarming support to be able to start its own journey apart from the annual flagship Art Jakarta. Working with galleries and artists to present their best is always an exciting collaboration. We hope that this unique experience can lead to more attention to art presentation in the public spaces of the city,” said Tom Tandio as the fair director. “We didn’t expect last year’s Art Jakarta Gardens to receive such positive responses from art galleries, artists, collectors and visitors in general. An outdoor art event, such as at Hutan Kota by Plataran, does provide a different atmosphere for visitors. Meanwhile, putting sculptures or installations in a garden environment can genuinely highlight the strengths of these works. We hope that Art Jakarta Gardens can become an inspiration so that many artworks can appear in Jakarta’s public spaces in the future.,” said Enin Supriyanto, Art Jakarta Gardens’ artistic director. The outdoor exhibition is intended to grow the people’s appreciation toward art and expand the artistic scene in the country. Visitors will be allowed to explore a combination of outdoor and indoor presentations of artworks in the form of sculptures, installations and two-dimensional objects. A designated section called the Sculpture Garden, will feature outdoor sculptures by artists such as Adi Gunawan, Ashley Bickerton, Gregorius Papadimitriou, Nyoman Nuarta, Richard Winkler and Yim Yen Sum. Moreover, there will also be an exhibition area displaying works from 22 galleries, both domestic and international. In a presentation by Bibit, FX Harsono, a Blitar-born internationally acclaimed artist, will be one of the highlights this year with his installation work, The Light of Journey, which will be placed in a specially designed space by this/PLAY. The company also stepped up as the event’s lead partner this year. “We believe that everyone deserves a fair opportunity to pursue their financial goals. Through our platform, Bibit is committed to empowering individuals to create the lives they desire and a better future. This year, together with Art Jakarta Gardens, Bibit is excited to show how art, just as Bibit, can empower everyone to achieve these goals,” said Olivia Budiono, product and marketing lead of Bibit. Other performances for the event also include special music shows presented by Sofar Sounds Jakarta, with the support of Bakti Budaya Djarum Foundation. Sofar Sounds Jakarta is part of a platform that reimagines live events through curated, secret performances in intimate settings in more than 350 cities around the world. Furthermore, there will also be a performance by artists from the network Wof performance art and experimental sound art. In a happening entitled Intraplay, artists Dimas E.

Therefore, Telkom and Telkomsel, as state-owned digital telecommunications companies, must become the backbone of Indonesia's digital economy,"" he added. The minister has had a hand in Telkom’s contribution to the country, instructing the SOE to focus on its digital business to become the largest digital telecommunications company in Southeast Asia. It is the government’s mission to deliver equitable access to digital technology and literacy across the archipelago. Achieving digital sovereignty involves at least three factors for consideration: the environment, society and the digital economy.

In terms of the digital literacy index, data from the Communication and Information Ministry reveal that Indonesia has scored 3.49 out of 5 to reach a mature level of digital literacy. This means that the country and its talents are ready to compete in the fast-approaching era of Society 5.0, harnessing digital innovations towards creating a sustainable, human-oriented socioeconomic system. Digital transformation has been in the spotlight of Indonesia’s Group of 20 presidency this year, and Telkom Indonesia is eager to contribute to realizing the G20 agenda under the leadership of Telkom President Director Ririek Adriansyah, who is also chairman of the B20 Digitalization Task Force. In collaboration with various parties, including other SOEs, Telkom aims to improve digital literacy by developing the PeduliLindungi mobile application, distributing Rumah BUMN assistance for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), providing the Amoeba and Indigo incubation facilities, and other efforts.

"Sustainability has a big impact on the environment and has grown as a trend in the business world, from big corporations to the MSMEs that bring Indonesia back to recovery. Moreover, the conversation on sustainability has been highlighted more than ever with the country’s position as the Group of Twenty (G20) President this year. Swiss Chamber of Commerce Indonesia, KADIN Indonesia and the European Business Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia (EuroCham) launched the Business Twenty (B20) Sustainability 4.0 Awards in May, which was welcomed by various businesses.

"After two years of hiatus, the National Crafts Council (Dewan Kerajinan Nasional/DEKRANAS) again held the Kriyanusa 2022 exhibition with the theme ""The Survival Spirit of Competitive Craftsmen"", which is taking place from Sept. 21-25 in Hall A, Jakarta Convention Center, Central Jakarta. First Lady Iriana and the general chair of the national DEKRANAS, fondly known as Mother of National Crafts, Wury Ma'ruf Amin, created the event. DEKRANAS, established on March 3, 1980, has become a pioneer in the association of activists in the national-handicraft industry. DEKRANAS is a driving element in the handicraft industry and has carried out its role as the government's partner in fostering and developing traditions and cultural heritages in making handicrafts that are increasingly qualified and competitive throughout the archipelago. Chairperson of the 2022 Kriyanusa Exhibition, Mrs. Elizabeth Thohir, stated that ""the main purpose of the 2022 Kriyanusa Exhibition is to help market DEKRANASDA-assisted products and provide space for the Nusantara handicraft industry to continue to strive for creativity and innovation to improve its business performance and display its superior products."" ""The handicraft industry is one sector that can adapt and innovate amid the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic so that it can survive, even support the national economic recovery [PEN],"" she added. Every year, the Kriyanusa exhibition carries different regional icons of the archipelago, and this year's Kriyanusa icons are from Lampung province: the bamboo shoots motif and the raja medal motif. This bamboo kuncup motif is commonly found in Javanese and Sumatran woven fabrics, which contain the saying: ""Noble at a young age, even more so in adulthood."" Bamboo still in the bud is very soft and nutritious to eat; but when it grows up, it stands firm – towers -- but bows low. In Lampung, this motif is worn by married women in traditional ceremonies and symbolizes fertility. The Raja medal motif is a motif with the shape of a ship and its crew, indicating its use for a woman of high rank, such as a kapal adat (donor’s wife). The ship's emblem is a tribute to Lampung's past as a maritime power. The 2022 Kriyanusa exhibition showcases better-quality handicraft products so that Indonesian handicraft products can increasingly become known worldwide. ""This exhibition is an excellent effort to encourage Indonesian handicraft products to go global,"" said Ms. Reni Yanita, secretary-general of the National Office of the Republic of Indonesia and the Director General of Small, Medium and Aneka Industries in the Industry Ministry. “In addition, Kriyanusa is a craft exhibition eagerly awaited by the public, not only from Indonesia but also abroad, because it displays regional, superior handicraft products produced by competent and competitive IKM actors,"" he said. Based on data from the Industry Ministry, the handicraft industry sub-sector can export with a value of US$916 million in 2021, an increase of 10.49% compared to the export value in 2020, which amounted to $829 million. In addition to data from the Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry, the contribution of the handicraft sub-sector to the national GDP in 2020 amounted to Rp 166.13 trillion, with the number of people working in the craft sub-sector of approximately 3.9 million people. Therefore, continued Reni, as a country with diverse ethnic groups, customs, arts, culture and language, Indonesia is considered to have the potential to produce various unique and quality crafts. ""Hopefully, this Kriyanusa exhibition will contribute to all participants by increasing productivity, as well as educating and stimulating their understanding in terms of actively and comprehensively promoting handicraft products,"" he said. The Kriyanusa 2022 exhibition will also be enlivened by talk shows, craft demonstrations, fashion shows and arts from various regions. DEKRANAS initiated the Kriyanusa 2022 event. It will be attended by 147 participants from various regions and supported by the Home Ministry; Office of the Coordinating Economic Minister; Industry Ministry; Education, Culture, Research and Technology Ministry; Trade Ministry; Investment Ministry; Transportation Ministry; Communications and Information Ministry; State-Owned Enterprises Ministry; Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry; Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry; and Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry, and sponsored by Bank Negara Indonesia, PT.

"A top international executive of a big company believes in the power of creating value as a key ingredient in a sustainably successful business. Vassilis Gkatzelis, newly appointed president director of Sampoerna, revealed how long-term value creation had played a contributing role in Sampoerna’s lifespan. “Sampoerna has a long history of 109 years.

I’m committing to continue the environment,” he said. . (./.) According to Gkatzelis, it’s always important to understand the history and culture of every country, “as well as your organization before you even think about the future of it, so I have been trying to understand.” Explaining further the Three Hands philosophy, he said, “The first is about the adult consumers and smokers, the second is our employees and our business partners and the third is our society at large.” “Everything we do at Sampoerna takes into account the long-term value creation and how Sampoerna creates value for the broader ecosystem. I think this is something very unique and very long-term oriented,” he said. Gkatzelis is no stranger to long-term value creation. It is deeply ingrained in his blood. Growing up in Athens, Greece, Gkatzelis learned impactful value creation from his grandparents, who ran a small family business. “I always saw what value creation means for the customers, for the employees and for the community at large,” said Gkatzelis who regards his grandparents as his role models. Gkatzelis embarked on his career with PMI as a graduate management trainee in 2003. Since then, he has climbed up the career ladder, holding important managerial positions in PMI, including managing director of Philip Morris Egypt & Levant Cluster and general manager of Philip Morris Morocco. In terms of leadership, Gkatzelis said, he always believed in creating value for the long term and creating value for a broad range of stakeholders. “So, in line with the Three Hands philosophy, I think this is the way that we need to think of what the future starting point is by anticipating the needs for the broader ecosystem. And this is what we do at Sampoerna.” “As a person, I fully support the idea of understanding key challenges and opportunities. As an organization, you are always a part of the broader ecosystem and your job is to make the world better, because as an organization you are here to solve some big challenges and opportunities, and that’s why thinking about customers, thinking about your employees, thinking about your partners and thinking about your society is the only way you can measure your value for the long term,” he said. Long-term mindset According to Gkatzelis, who earned a global executive MBA from INSEAD, it takes a lot of forward thinking. “I have seen that Sampoerna has been always adopting this long-term mindset, and that’s why it has a history that happened many years and an even brighter future,” he remarked.   “And it’s not by a coincidence, but it presents the value across a very vast value-chain. So, this is my guidance to stakeholders, always in forward thinking – two-ways,” he added. Some of the long-term value creation at Sampoerna that Gkatzelis was proud of was the company’s step to partner with hundreds of thousands of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Gkatzelis noted how Sampoerna had handled the issue of employees during the COVID-19 pandemic as the implementation of the Three Hands philosophy. “Sampoerna has been always prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of its people. We are extremely happy and honored that Sampoerna has worked collaboratively with many stakeholders, governments and professionals, KADIN [the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry], and other key institutions to vaccinate all the employees, including booster vaccines. “In the organizations, we take into account our direct and indirect employees. More than 65,000 employees in Sampoerna, and we also tremendously try to secure jobs.” “At the same time, technology has allowed us to work remotely and achieve results by connecting [through] digital platforms. “So, we believe not only in our family, but also, as you know, Sampoerna has the broad network of more than 165,000 MSMEs. We call it Sampoerna Retail Community (SRC), so we have been using digitalization to connect and grow. Safety, well-being and, at the same time, connectivity and digitalization,” he said.  According to him, well-being has many elements, including those associated with physics, mentality and finance. “So, I’m very proud that Sampoerna has been supporting the environment, not only inside the company but also in the broader ecosystem. We are always committed to supporting our employees, the economy and the society of Indonesia,” he affirmed.  To demonstrate its commitment to long-term value creation, Sampoerna has invested in building a manufacturing facility in Karawang, West Java, to produce heated tobacco products, HEETS for IQOS. “The products do not create combustion, and they don’t burn tobacco, and so they heat tobacco to represent a better alternative versus continuing smoking,” he explained. He revealed that better alternatives had been the focus of PMI for almost two decades. “We have invested more than US$9 billion for the developments, scientific substantiations, manufacturing, commercialization and continuous improvements of the variety of platforms that do not combust tobacco, that are better alternatives for adult smoker,” he noted. Sustainability According Gkatzelis, sustainability is at the core of the way Sampoerna does business, which is in line with the company’s Three Hands philosophy. “This is also aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals [SDGs],” he added. “So we are always keen on creating an ecosystem that has multiplier effects in the economy. Just to give you an example, as I said before, Sampoerna has 38 different manufacturing facilities which are operated by third parties, and they are located in rural and different areas and provinces, which create an ecosystem and generations in the broader community.” On sustainability, Sampoerna has been supporting the progress of MSMEs in Indonesia through the Sampoerna Entrepreneurship Training Center since 2007 and the Sampoerna Retail Community (SRC) since 2008. “When it comes to MSMEs, part of sustainability is how to create inclusive growth and development. You know the tobacco sector is reliant on and employs millions of those in MSMEs, from farmers to retailers and different type of entrepreneurs.” According to him, the same applies to SRC, which started in Medan more than 10 years ago. In 2008, SRC had only a few traditional retailers and to date, it has more than 165,000 members. To support these retailers, SRC is helping them across their whole area of businesses. “These entrepreneurs have increased their business level by 50 percent after joining Sampoerna’s [MSME development programs], and they have access to finance, education, technology,” he said. Digitalization of their business is a very important part of Sampoerna’s priority. “I think this is also the country's priority to transform digitally,” he noted. He said he had personally met many of the company’s retail communities, where almost 60 percent of them are female entrepreneurs who are also breadwinners for their family. “So, we are also supporting a very diverse part of the population, and this is growing,” he noted. Gkatzelis said Sampoerna had aspirations to grow further by giving support to the MSME ecosystem as one of the ways to create a value for the whole ecosystem. The MSMEs have the so called Pojok Lokal or Local Corner where the community can send art, crafts and culinary products. The Sampoerna Entrepreneurship Training Center is another program under which more than 56,000 people were trained the last year.  Sampoerna also runs other programs for farmers, focusing on agricultural labor practices under which they can become more sustainable and can help key talents thrive. With respect to farmers, he said, Sampoerna had another program with more than 20,000 farmers. “So, I think we have plenty of programs on how sustainability is becoming part of the way we do business, taking into account the adult smokers, adult consumers, the environment, the social situation and the country,” he said. “So Sampoerna has always tried and been committed to create value for the broader ecosystem,” he pointed out. Asked how he described his leadership style, Gkatzelis said, “My leadership style, I think, starts with listening to our key stakeholders.” Gkatzelis revealed how he spent his first three months going around Indonesia, where he met the employees, SRC communities, ibu-ibu in hand-rolled facilities, business partners and people from authorities. “I have tried to understand what the needs and expectations from the different stakeholder groups are,” he said. “Through listening and understanding their needs, if you have an open mindset, I think this is where you create value,” he added. “I think my leadership style is listening, collaborating together and always trying to give value beyond just the pure economic profit for corporations. “So, I'm here. This is my new home. They are all my family. Sampoerna is my new family, and I'm here to enjoy and create value for Indonesia at large,” he concluded.","Vassilis Gkatzelis, the new president director of Sampoerna, believes in the importance of creating long-term value for all key stakeholders, which he believes is key to the company's success and longevity. Gkatzelis grew up learning the importance of value creation from his grandparents who ran a small business and has a long-term mindset, which he says is a critical factor in the success of Sampoerna. He is committed to continuing the company's ""Three Hands"" philosophy which prioritizes the well-being of adult consumers, employees, business partners, and society at large. Gkatzelis is proud of the company's partnership with micro, small and medium enterprises and their response to the COVID-19 pandemic by prioritizing the safety and well-being of employees, and using technology to connect and grow their retail community."

"The maritime boundary is one of the main concerns of Indonesia as an archipelagic country. For decades, Indonesia has been negotiating with neighboring countries regarding the determination of maritime boundaries. One such negotiation is the one related to the determination of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) boundary with Vietnam. Indonesia and Vietnam began negotiations for the first time on May 21, 2010. There have been dozens of negotiations between the two countries since then. Differences in understanding related to the EEZ have not yet found a compromise satisfactory for both parties. Both Indonesia and Vietnam have proposed unilateral-boundary lines. Indonesia proposes a maritime-boundary line that is different from the seabed-boundary line. Meanwhile, Vietnam proposes a sea-boundary line that is the same as the seabed-boundary line.  This difference makes their claims overlap. ""Recently, a new round of negotiation on the determination of the RI-Vietnam EEZ started again. On 14-16 July 2022, the Indonesian and Vietnamese technical teams have held the 14th Technical Meeting for the Determination of the RI-Vietnam EEZ,"" said Yulius Yohanes, an international relations observer from Tanjungpura University, in a written presentation, on Sept. 5. ""At the meeting, the two parties reached an agreement to rectify one of the coordinates of the EEZ boundary line proposed by Indonesia. With these improvements, around 6,500 square kilometers of remaining area is formed,"" he explained. Based on the negotiation process, the Indonesian Technical Team has granted concessions to Vietnam, while Vietnam has abandoned its basic single-boundary line position. This made the Indonesian Technical Team consider granting a larger concession. Indonesia's proposal line has moved down to the south about 65 percent of the total area formed from the unilateral claims of the two countries. The Indonesian Technical Team is even considering granting a maximum concession of about 10 percent more. According to Yulius Yohanes, Vietnam is trying to achieve maximum profit, and is considered to have not fulfilled its commitment to move from the basic-claim position. This is not a win-win negotiation. Responding to the circulating results of the discussion, the member of the First Commission of the House of Representatives of Sukamta expressed his surprise. According to Sukamta, the negotiations on the establishment of the state borders are a sensitive issue, concerning the sovereignty of Indonesia's territory. ""At a glance, we must see this as a loss for Indonesia, because of the loss of part of the territory that Indonesia has claimed all this time. We certainly don't want the past incident of Sipadan-Ligitan to repeat...So the position of Indonesia's claim in the disputed area in the North Natuna Sea is already strong internationally and legally. Why is the news that Indonesian Technical Team gives concessions to Vietnam?  This becomes the question."" said Sukamta on Sept. 7. So far, there has been friction between Indonesia and Vietnam, which has led to conflicts over the issue of illegal fishing that happens within Indonesia's territorial waters. The latest incident occurred on July 24. The Indonesian Navy's ship, Cut Nyak Dien-375 BKO Sea, detained two fishing vessels with the Vietnamese flag. As a result, the Indonesian Navy arrested 16 crew members (ABK) and fish weighing 10 tonnes. Professor of International Maritime Law at Diponegoro University, Eddy Pratomo, said that the delimitation of Indonesia's maritime boundaries is a crucial issue, because it can protect the country's sovereignty. However, the delimitation of maritime boundaries is not an easy matter that can be taken care of quickly by the state. Indonesia must keep trying to defend the sovereignty of the country by continuing to fight for every inch of its territory.","Indonesia and Vietnam have been negotiating the determination of their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) boundary for over a decade. Both countries have proposed different boundary lines, leading to overlap in their claims. The most recent negotiation, the 14th Technical Meeting, resulted in agreement to rectify one of Indonesia's proposed coordinates. Indonesia has granted concessions to Vietnam, moving its proposed boundary line southward by 65% of the total area formed from the initial claims. The Indonesian Technical Team is even considering granting up to 10% more concession. However, this has caused concern in Indonesia, with some expressing that the concessions may be seen as a loss of territory for Indonesia. The delimitation of Indonesia's maritime boundaries is crucial in protecting the country's sovereignty but it is a complex and sensitive issue that requires continued efforts. The issue of illegal fishing has caused friction between the two countries in the past, with the most recent incident resulting in the arrest of 16 Vietnamese crew members by the Indonesian Navy."
"From the lunch you bought through an online food delivery service to the batik shirt you wear on Fridays; micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are an integral part of Indonesia’s daily life and economy. According to a recent study by e-commerce platform Blibli in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Litbang Kompas, 99 percent of all business entities in Indonesia are MSMEs, contributing 60 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP). In his keynote address at the JakPost UpClose #43: What Awaits MSMEs in Indonesia’s Digital Supremacy webinar, Co- operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises Minister Teten Masduki noted that digitalization was essential for MSMEs, which employ 97 percent of Indonesia’s workforce, to rise and grow in their capacity as pillars of the national economy. “To date, approximately 19.95 million MSMEs are connected to the digital ecosystem. The President has also mandated that 30 million MSMEs are on board the digital ecosystem in 2024. We believe that by increasing the number of MSMEs in the digital ecosystem, we can optimize the potential of the digital economy that is projected to be worth Rp 4.53 trillion [US$56.95 billion] in 2030,” he said. Haikal Siregar, managing di- rector and partner at Boston Consulting Group’s Jakarta office, explained that the government’s sentiments are in line with the study’s findings. The study identified three main issues faced by MSMEs, which include high operating costs, difficulty in driving revenue growth and barriers in terms of scaling and competitiveness. These is- sues were exacerbated by the CO - VID -19 pandemic, which caused reduced sales volume, shrinking capital resources as well as distribution bottlenecking. “If there comes a time when they face other challenges, digitalization can help MSMEs as it enables them to reach a national or global audience, create operational efficiency, as well as streamline their transactions,” he said. Mira Tayyiba, the Communications and Information Ministry secretary-general, as well as chair of the Group of 20 Digital Economy Working Group, said that global economic growth was projected to be at 2.9 percent in 2022, down from 5.7 percent in 2021. Due to the downturn, data from the Finance Ministry showed that Indonesia was expected to lose Rp 1.36 trillion in missed opportunities to create added value. “To achieve stable and continued growth, stronger macro- economic stability and a robust financial system is a must. It is believed that developing the MSME sector can and has contributed to Indonesia’s economic recovery and growth,” she said. Mind-boggling challenges Blibli CEO and cofounder Kusumo Martanto said the fact that MSMEs faced numerous challenges despite their major role in the economy was “mind-boggling”. “When we started Blibli, we thought that as an Indonesian company made by Indonesians, there is something we can do to ad- dress the issue. We conducted the study last year, but Blibli itself has actively explored ideas on what we can do [for MSMEs],” he said. Kusumo highlighted one finding from the study, which forecast Indonesia to become the largest contributor to the digital economy in Southeast Asia by 2025. According to the study, MSMEs that had gone online were able to earn 1.1 times more revenue com- pared with those that only had an offline presence. Online MSMEs were also 2.1 times more likely to sell goods nationwide, and 4.6 times more likely to export to international markets. At the same time, MSMEs with an online presence were 1.1 times more likely to involve their local community, while also 1.3 times more likely to hire others. “If we look at it, MSMEs that have gone online are not only beneficial for themselves, but also for their surrounding communities,” Haikal said, adding that increasing MSME digital literacy from 20 to 50 percent can result in an estimated US$38 billion uplift by 2024.","Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are a significant part of Indonesia's economy and daily life, accounting for 99% of all business entities and contributing 60% of the country's GDP. The government is aiming to increase the number of MSMEs in the digital ecosystem, as digitalization is considered essential for the growth of these businesses, which employ 97% of Indonesia's workforce. A recent study by Blibli and Boston Consulting Group identified three main challenges faced by MSMEs: high operating costs, difficulty in driving revenue growth, and barriers to scaling and competitiveness. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these issues. The study found that MSMEs with an online presence earned 1.1 times more revenue and were 2.1 times more likely to sell goods nationwide and 4.6 times more likely to export to international markets. The increase in MSME digital literacy from 20 to 50% could result in an estimated $38 billion uplift by 2024."
"Prodia Food Health Laboratory (FHL), under PT Prodia OHI International, offers microbiological examination, chemical examination and nutrition fact examination. Located in Sanur, the lab opened its doors in 2018 to ensure quality and food safety for food, beverages, the surrounding environment, hygiene and sanitation. Microbiological examination includes detecting bacteria, such as E. coli, yeast and salmonella, among others, while chemical examination is carried out to detect levels of chemicals in a product, such as methanol and other food additives. Lastly, analysis of nutrition in food is carried out to assess the levels of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, total calories and vitamins and minerals. With a commitment to providing quality and reliable services, Prodia FHL periodically sends its sample test results to the Food Analysis Performance Assessment Scheme (FAPAS), which is a proficiency testing institution for internationally recognized food laboratories. These efforts were continued in 2020 to start the process of applying for accreditation of testing laboratories for ISO/IEC 17025:2017, a credit the lab obtained in July of 2022. The accreditation was formally announced by the Director of PT. Prodia OHI, Bertha Pangaribuan, M.Si. in her speech at the Launch of ISO 17025:2017 (ISO) Food Health Laboratory at Swiss-Belresort Watu Jimbar on Monday. Along with Bertha, the special occasion was also attended by Jeanny, the head of the Prodia FHL branch, the board of commissioners of Prodia Group, sister companies, related government agencies, as well as companies and customers that have collaborated with Prodia in the past. The event also marked a collaboration in the fields of education, research and community development between Udayana University and Prodia OHI via an agreement that was signed by both parties. With that in mind, Andi Wijaya, the chief commissioner of Prodia, said quality was the main thing for Prodia and that, therefore, Prodia Group's motto was Love for Quality. This is in line with Prodia FHL's commitment as an ISO accredited laboratory. The new accreditation can be seen as an improvement in reputation for the laboratory, as testing results can now be recognized both at home and abroad. The certification also brought new responsibilities for Prodia FHL, which is expected to be able to synergize in supporting national development programs, especially in the development of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in testing food products to be registered as well as for testing quality control of food samples for business actors in the food and beverage sector. Drs. I Made Bagus Gerametta, Apt (Head of the National Agency of Drug and Food Control Denpasar) represented by Mrs. Lilis Purwanti, S.Farm., Apt, congratulated the accreditation of FHL as a testing laboratory. The accreditation of Prodia FHL services complements Prodia OHI services. The OHI Indtox laboratory has already been recognized with an ISO 17025 accreditation and has also been registered with the Environment and Forestry Ministry as an environmental laboratory. It is hoped that the presence of Prodia FHL in Bali can provide easy accessibility to accredited food labs in Bali and eastern Indonesia and actively support the implementation of occupational nutrition in the workplace, especially because quality of food should be a concern for everyone.","Prodia Food Health Laboratory (FHL), located in Sanur, is a division of PT Prodia OHI International.

"PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI) has joined forces with Telkomsel, adopting the first 5G Underground Smart Mining technology in Southeast Asia to support the digitalization and operational transformation of Indonesia’s mining industry. The innovation enables automatization and remote operation for improved work safety and productivity across PTFI. President Joko Widodo was accompanied by State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Minister Erick Thohir, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Arifin Tasrif, Investment Minister/Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) Head Bahlil Lahadalia and State Secretary Pratikno in launching the 5G Underground Smart Mining on Sept. 1, 2022 at a PTFI workshop in Tembagapura, Papua. “One of our key priorities is to realize technology leadership,” said Erick. “Referring to a study by Deloitte International in 2021, 5G has been tested and implemented in the United States, Sweden, China and Russia, resulting in improved productivity of up to 25 percent, [while] operating costs, particularly in the drilling sector, decreased to 40 percent and energy savings [increased] up to 20 percent,” he added, expressing his hope that Indonesia would see similar improvements. “Following the successful implementation of the first 5G network in Indonesia today, Telkomsel maintains its commitment to strengthening the ecosystem of 5G implementation by presenting the first 5G Underground Smart Mining at PTFI,” said Telkomsel CEO Hendri Mulya Syam. “This will strengthen our nation’s digital sovereignty through Industry 4.0 through the automation of the mining sector and improvements in the digital capabilities of human resources,” Hendri emphasized. Telkomsel has deployed six 5G base transceiver stations (BTS) to cover PTFI’s mining sites in Tembagapura, including underground mines. As PTFI CEO Tony Wenas explained, mining activities took place at depths of more than 1,500 meters underground and posed a substantial risk for workers and assets. The 5G Underground Smart Mining technology could limit the potential dangers through its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered camera. Smart mining is the latest technology driving the optimization of mining operations by employing AI, the internet of things (IoT), machine learning and big data for the sector. Telkomsel’s latest innovation is designed to digitalize underground mining activities and is expected to change the operating framework of the whole industry. The benefits of implementing 5G smart mining include its low latencies, which will ensure real-time monitoring and supervision, so mining companies can integrate all data to create safer work processes. It also offers faster network access to transmit data in real time, allowing companies to utilize the data for quicker and better decision-making among operations managers. The 5G Underground Smart Mining also offers wider 5G network coverage for connecting more devices for greater efficiency in operating costs while reducing the carbon footprint of mining activities, leading to less environmental harm. As the first digital company to successfully deploy 5G networks across the country, Telkomsel has so far provided its Hyper 5G network in 39 cities supported by 248 units of 5G BTS. In its previous efforts to deploy 5G technology across industries and companies, Telkomsel jas collaborated with Schneider Electric to implement the 5G Smart Manufacture in Batam and with PT Jababeka Infrastruktur to implement the Smart Industrial in Jababeka, West Java. “I am confident that this breakthrough implementation of 5G Underground Smart Mining supported by Telkomsel can also be applied to other [companies] in Indonesia’s mining ecosystem and [prompt] more digital innovations in the mining industry, which in turn will bring plenty of benefits to society and the country,” said Erick. “Telkomsel continues to move beyond boundaries to open more opportunities for collaboration as the company accelerates the cross-sector digital transformation road map through the use of more comprehensive 5G technology,” said Hendri. “We will ensure that this digital transformation will also contribute to the growth of Indonesia’s digital economy, inclusively and sustainably,” he underlined.","PT Freeport Indonesia and Telkomsel have partnered to launch the first 5G Underground Smart Mining technology in Southeast Asia.

"Accepting each other as we are is the premise of Violet: Warna yang Berbeda (Violet: A different color), a musical by Svatuhari Theater that reflects the unique characteristics of each “color” across all layers of Indonesian society. Inspired by the traditional textiles of East Nusa Tenggara, Violet depicts the journey of the titular character, played by Zsazsa Utari, to accept her own “color” that has made her different from others since she was born. The musical’s message of diversity and universal acceptance embodies the national motto, Bhineka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity). The theatrical troupe’s producer Joseph Moris and director Rinaldy Zulkarnain are also encouraging more female artists to embrace and spread the message of Bhineka Tunggal Ika through their work, not just for themselves and the Indonesian people, but also for the nation’s art and culture.

"The opening stage of the 2023 F1 Powerboat World Championship (F1H20) from Feb. 24 to 26 at Lake Toba, North Sumatra, is expected to help propel Indonesia’s tourism and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) industries onto the global stage. The F1H20 is one of the first international sporting events Indonesia will be hosting this year, followed by the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, shared with Japan and the Philippines. A well-organized event would determine Indonesia’s capabilities in hosting international events, Youth and Sports Minister Zainudin Amali told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday. “[Delegates from] hundreds of countries will [be coming] to watch the championship. Successful sporting events will attract more international travel to Indonesia while also boosting national economic growth,” the minister said. “Therefore, we ask that public figures, businesses and communities around Lake Toba will also be part of the success of the 2023 F1H2O at Lake Toba by promoting it,” he added. Zainudin also thanked the Communication and Information Ministry (Kemenkominfo) for its massive campaigns to publicize the 2023 F1H2O: “We appreciate the Kemenkominfo’s efforts to spread awareness of the championship, especially among international journalists.” Meanwhile, the communication ministry made assurances that preparations were underway to ensure that the communication infrastructure, especially internet access, would be on a par with the quality of communication technology during the 2022 Indonesian MotoGP race, held at the Pertamina Mandalika International Street Circuit in Central Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara. “The ministry has coordinated with the Office of the Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister and cellular operators to improve the area’s connectivity during the F1H20, like we did in 2022 with the Mandalika MotoGP,” said Usman Kasong, the ministry’s director general of information and public communication. “Back then, we received positive feedback [from international journalists] for the speedy 5G connection. Media representatives from across the country and abroad were able to quickly send videos, pictures and articles to their countries,” he added. The communication ministry would also set up a media center and other facilities for use by both Indonesian and international media. “We’ve also contacted a number of foreign news outlets to broadcast this international event, as up to 140 million people will be watching on television, or even directly at Lake Toba,” Usman said. The F1H20 organizing committee expressed its hope that the extensive media coverage would bolster not only sports development of powerboat racing, but also the promotion of Lake Toba as a priority destination and in turn, the local economy. “Right now, we are aiming to recover Lake Toba by building physical infrastructure and readying the [local] community, including [MSMEs] around Lake Toba,” Usman said. The event is expected to help kick-start the recovery of Lake Toba’s tourism sector. The government is targeting 1.3 million domestic and international tourists to Lake Toba and surrounding areas, such as the nearby city of Balige as well as Samosir regency. To prepare for the surge in tourist arrivals, the government has made improvements to points of entry, including Silangit International Airport in North Tapanuli and renowned Kualanamu International Airport in the provincial capital of Medan.","Indonesia is hosting the 2023 F1 Powerboat World Championship (F1H20) from Feb. 24 to 26 at Lake Toba, North Sumatra. This is one of the first international sporting events Indonesia will host this year, followed by the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The success of the event will showcase Indonesia's ability to host international events and boost its tourism and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) industries.

"In preparation for 2024’s 10th World Water Forum (WWF), the National Stakeholders’ Forum (NSF) was held at the Public Works and Housing Ministry’s auditorium on Thursday. The forum served as an official announcement to international stakeholders, including political leaders, decisionmakers, bilateral partners, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), business leaders, members of the international media, water scientists and engineers, as well as the representatives of civil society. It was also a response to the framework agreement signed between the World Water Council and the Indonesian government in November of last year in Bali. It officially marked a series of preparations for the upcoming 10th World Water Forum (WWF) in Bali under the theme “Water for Shared Prosperity”. A National Organizing Committee (NOC), consisting of representatives from provincial governments and ministries, was announced in accordance with Presidential Decree (Keppres) No. 1/2023. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo appointed Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Binsar Panjaitan as the committee’s chairman. He will be supported by deputy chairman and Bali governor I Wayan Koster and daily chairman and Public Works and Housing Minister Basuki Hadimuljono. The ministry will play an important role in leading the events, as regional physical infrastructure also plays a large part in the discussion of water resource management, especially with Indonesia’s uniquely diverse physical geography and hydrological characteristics. “A landscape approach is applied in developing natural resource management policies, including water, which is in line with [the President’s] direction that infrastructure development go hand-in-hand with environmental improvement and restoration,” said Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar in her keynote speech. “The implementation of natural landscape governance in the management of water resources is very important because the approach prioritizes balance with environmental conservation, developmental economics and human welfare through strong, comprehensive policy integration and law enforcement,” she added. At the forum, the committee also presented the road map to the 2024 forum in Bali and invited stakeholders to actively be part of the discussion in improving global water resource management. “This meeting will provide a timely place for the participants to discuss thematic, regional and political priorities. We expect every participant to [propose] their opinions and concrete plans of action to resolve imminent challenges in water resource management,” said Public Works and Housing Ministry secretary general Muhammad Zainal Fatah in an opening speech. In keeping with the forum components, thematic, regional and political, the NSF provides a space to discuss the foundations of critical water issues, perspectives on water from communities from all regions of the world and opportunities for discussion with elected government officials. The meeting also invited young people including students, recent college graduates and young professionals in various organizations and associations to take part in the Young Water Sustainability Leaders (YWSL) series of events. The program will help young people gain field experience in water sustainability and encourage them to engage with governments, industries and institutions in an international setting. With ongoing collaborations between the public, government and public sector, as well as the upcoming World Water Forum, it is hoped that every stakeholder will recognize water fairness and equality as a right that must be accessible to all and contribute to a sustainable future in global water conservation. The World Water Forum will be held from May 18 to 24, 2024. Aiming to be the “largest and most memorable water forum”, the forum will potentially boost the local economy by inviting 12 heads of state and 56 ministers, 10,000 delegates and 100,000 participants (including participants, exhibition attendees and small and medium enterprises [SMEs]) from 172 countries. As a follow-up to the National Stakeholder Forum, a 10th World Water Forum Kick-Off Meeting will be held on Feb. 15 and 16 at the Jakarta Convention Center to provide public participants with essential information on the overall framework and how to engage in the planning and preparatory process for the World Water Forum.","The National Stakeholders’ Forum was held in Indonesia to officially announce preparations for the upcoming 10th World Water Forum (WWF) in Bali.

"The Association of Indonesian City Governments (APEKSI), in collaboration with the German government's international cooperation agency for sustainable development (GIZ), held the “Kick Off Meeting for Mainstreaming Inclusive Job Centers for City Governments” on Wednesday at Hotel JS Luwansa Kuningan in Jakarta. The event was conducted in a hybrid format via Zoom in order to allow more access to a wider audience. The Inclusive Job Center (IJC), developed by the Social Protection Project (GIZ SPP) and BPJS Ketengakerjaan, was introduced as a concept of building an ecosystem that encourages the empowerment and integration of persons with disabilities into the job market. It is expected that initiative will bring more opportunities for disabled people to enter the formal labor market through capacity building, according to the needs of the company and available job opportunities. Essentially, IJC is a tool to create an inclusive labor market (ILM) that provides equal access and opportunities for persons with disabilities and leaves no one behind. The initiative is in line with Government Regulation No. 60/2020 on the Disability Service Unit (ULD) in the Employment Sector, which requires local governments to establish ULDs and provide quality services for persons with disabilities to access jobs. The meeting also highlights the importance of IJC and its ability to be disseminated to city governments, because local governments have an important role in providing services to persons with disabilities to obtain equal employment rights. ""Our problem has been [an inability] to maximize the demographic bonus, including how to properly facilitate colleagues with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. Inclusive cities are expected to […] facilitate all components of citizens, including colleagues with disabilities, by opening up economic resources and livelihoods that can be accessed equally,” said chairman of the APEKSI Management Board and Bogor Mayor Bima Arya Sugiarto. “The Inclusive Job Center is a good concept that is expected to be able to assist local governments in facilitating colleagues with disabilities in building an inclusive job market. If it is built in a pentahelix manner, it will not only create demand for job opportunities but also contribute to improving skills. It is hoped that people with disabilities will also contribute to the Indonesian economy toward Golden Indonesia 2045,” he continued. It was revealed that the event was attended by 157 participants, consisting of APEKSI officials, relevant ministries, local government associations, organizations of persons with disabilities, CSOs, BUMN, the private sector, universities/research institutions and the media. The meeting also marks the start of the Inclusive Employment Center Mainstreaming Program for City Governments. In addition to the hybrid event, the program also consists of the preparation of guidelines, production of educational/campaign materials in the form of infographics and videos, training, national seminars, radio talk shows and a consolidation forum that will implemented until February 2023. The program is also done in collaboration with the Working Group Toward an APEKSI Inclusive City, which was formed in 2017. Cut Sri Rozanna, director of the GIZ Social Protection Program, said the IJC was held to convert people with disabilities who were recipients of economic assistance into economic contributors in Indonesia. Furthermore, it was hoped that the event would empower them, as the basic principles in implementing IJC are integrated and comprehensive empowerment from upstream to downstream, sustainability and protection. Isnavodiar Jatmiko, deputy director of service and channel development for BPJS Ketengakerjaan said, ""Almost 30 people a day experience work accidents. We go through the Return to Work Program as an initial effort to build an Inclusive Job Center.” Meanwhile, Edy Supriyanto, chair of the SEHATI Foundation, said the center could help eradicate extreme poverty in the country. Wahdi Siradjuddin, mayor of metro as chair of the Working Group Towards Inclusive Cities APEKSI emphasized that issuing regional regulations was not enough for local governments and that real action was needed in the form of providing equal space and opportunities for all. APEKSI, through this program, is not only for the 28 Pokja cities, as efforts have been made to invite all city governments so that they are ready to become inclusive cities in the future.","The Association of Indonesian City Governments (APEKSI) and the German government's GIZ held a ""Kick Off Meeting for Mainstreaming Inclusive Job Centers for City Governments"" in Jakarta.

"Inclusivity and diversity in the workplace has the positive effect of supporting sustainable business growth. Diageo, a trusted and respected global alcohol beverage company, has wholly embraced the values of inclusivity and diversity to reflect social diversity driven by global interconnectedness. Diageo reinforced its commitment to inclusivity and diversity through its 10-year strategic plan, “Society of 2030: Spirit of Progress”, recently unveiled in Jakarta. To ensure balanced male-female representation in the workplace up to the management level, especially in the male-dominated alcohol industry in which it operates, Diageo has set a target to reach 50 percent female representation in its leadership by 2030. According to Diageo, balanced representation of males and females and diversity not only brings strength as it allows employees and leadership team to expand their horizon, but also supports them in the decision making process. Diageo Southeast Asia managing director Preeti Razdan and Diageo Indonesia president director Alefiyah Sarma shared their views about the importance of fostering female leadership in the company. The two executives, who are both female, were of the view that opening more leadership roles for women not only contributed to the company’s growth but also its sustainability, as well as had a positive impact on the local community and broader society. For example, putting more females in leadership roles expanded perspectives. “The more diversity of thought, the better solutions you will have,” said Alefiyah, who was appointed as president director of Diageo Indonesia several months ago. “Besides having passion in the work that I do, I think the alcohol beverage industry will continue to thrive and expand. It allows me to gain a wide range of skills, including logical thinking, good communication, creativity, teamwork and leadership,” she said, speaking of what drove her to pursue a career in the alcohol industry. “Especially in Diageo, our mission is to drive positive change in our business and society. This is where I feel that I can play an important part in contributing positive change,” Alefiyah added. According to her, part of the joy she experienced as a leader was the opportunity to meet and work with many people who shared the same vision and mission. These encounters also led her to motivate and inspire them to do their best in pursuing projects and goals that allowed them to grow. Ensuring balanced representation in the workplace was part of Diageo’s strategy to realize its ambition to achieve its best performance. “From the sales point of view, of course, we will optimize our product distribution and sales with various innovations that can fulfill consumers’ needs,” Alefiyah said. “While optimizing product sales, we also want to be the most trusted and respected consumer product company, and at the same time, we want to create a positive impact on our company, within our communities and for society. “We are really proud of what we do to move forward. One of the key things that drives us is how we do [this] in a sustainable way. Sustainability is the heart of everything that we do,” she underlined. Alefiyah said that five of the nine people on Diageo Indonesia’s leadership team were women, or above Diageo’s global diversity target of 50 percent. Meanwhile, 70 percent of the communities that Diageo Indonesia supported through its community initiatives were women. “They are engaged in our business operation as employees, suppliers, distributors and [others]. They are on our inclusivity and diversity agenda,” she added. “So we continue to focus on upskilling and reskilling women as [part of] our concrete actions. The key here is to represent the population. That’s what we want the company to be.” Continuing, Alefiyah said Diageo’s inclusivity and diversity values also informed “how we interact with our suppliers and our partners”. “We are part of them and again, at the end of the day, we have a conversation and take actions behind the conversation,” she said. “That’s our guiding light. Doing [business] in a sustainable way is really very important for us. So for us, as we go into the future, we really want to do things in a very respectful and sustainable way while adhering to the policy of the country.” In this vein, Diageo Indonesia had developed educational programs that promote positive and responsible drinking, such as DRINKiQ and SMASHED. SMASHED, Diageo's flagship global program, aims to develop soft skills and break the culture of bullying, peer pressure and underage drinking while reducing alcohol-related harm around the world. DRINKiQ is an online platform dedicated to responsible drinking that provides facts about alcohol, its effects on the body and mind, and the impact of harmful drinking on individuals and society. “This is our journey that we are constantly improving,” Alefiyah said. Inclusion and Diversity Diageo implements a comprehensive inclusivity and diversity policy, starting from recruiting female employees and developing them to a leadership role. Razdan said female employees had equal opportunity to build their skills and manage assignments. “You have to know how to groom them, how to train them and how to make them confident,” she added. Globally, Diageo has achieved female leadership representation of almost 40 percent, while the figure in Southeast Asia has reached 44 percent. According to Razdan, the company expected to reach 50 percent female representation in 2030. “I think female leaders is the whole delivery of that you bring in,” Razdan said. “When you look at sustainability, it is not just [about] environmental sustainability,” said Razdan. “We also talk about sustainability in society and community, and this really represents the right way that a community should build. “How we empower women is really an equally important part of our thinking in the company. That’s why we do that [both] internally and externally.” Diageo’s 50 percent target extends beyond the company as a means to drive sustainability, and this goal applies equally to its suppliers, partners and the communities in which it works. In particular, Razdan said, the company’s inclusivity and diversity pillar informs “how we support [communities] and bring them that whole gender balance”. The company’s policies are subject to periodical review to ensure that they align with its female leadership agenda and to develop new policies oriented toward supporting female employees, such as maternity leave and a WFH policy for female workers. “Recently, we’ve just launched a regulation on menopause, domestic violence and others,” said Razdan. “Again, we should not stop there.” She added that inclusivity and diversity were central to Diageo’s business: “Long-term compensation is not only linked to financial delivery, but is equally linked to the delivery of the ‘Spirit of Progress’ [strategy], the metrics of which inclusion and diversity are a big part. “I think very few companies in the world has put [the gender agenda] as high as as Diageo has. That’s why, as we look at our progressive policy, we see the progress [made] because we are thinking of it every day,” said Razdan. “Diageo takes a big step every year and moves ahead further and further, and makes sure that women are in their role and have a job.” Alefiyah, meanwhile, shared her hope that Diageo could inspire others to do the same: not only focus on business but also empower and make a good impact on society and communities to develop a better industry.","Diageo, a global alcohol beverage company, has embraced inclusivity and diversity as part of its 10-year plan ""Society of 2030: Spirit of Progress."" The company has set a target of 50% female representation in leadership by 2030.

"The Transportation Ministry started its fiscal year of 2023 with the dispatch of the first ship on the latest Maritime Highway (Tol Laut) route on Thursday. The KM Kendhaga Nusantara 7 will begin its journey serving the T-14, Tanjung Perak – Larantuka (Tabilota) – Lembata (Lewoleba) – Kalabahi – Tanjung Perak, route. The maiden voyage was launched by the director general of sea transportation, represented by the director of sea transportation traffic at the Transportation Ministry, Capt. Hendri Ginting, and attended by representatives from state-owned shipping company PT Pelni, the Trade Ministry, the Office of the Maritime Affairs and Investment Coordinating Minister and other relevant stakeholders. “We hope that with the dispatch of the first Maritime Highway ship at the beginning of this year, it will motivate us to drive the success of the Maritime Highway program and meet the logistical needs of basic and important goods in frontier, remote and disadvantaged areas [T3P] in accordance with the Presidential Decree No. 27/2021,” said Hendri at Tanjung Perak Port, Surabaya. He further hoped that the service would accommodate the delivery of staple goods to areas such as West Nusa Tenggara. “I thank every party who supported the Maritime Highway in 2022, especially stakeholders who have utilized the Maritime Highway ships. We hope that the implementation of the Maritime Highway [in 2023] will improve,” Hendri added. Special staff of the transportation minister for inter-agency relations, Buyung Lalana, added that the Maritime Highway was part of a government effort to reduce price disparities in T3P areas. “The Maritime Highway has made a considerable impact, for example in Papua,” he added. The Maritime Highway also aims to deliver shipments by central and regional governments as well as businesses, utilizing return cargo to market regional commodities to create an even logistics distribution network throughout the archipelago.

"Fujifilm, the imaging, information and document solutions giant, has been diversifying its business for a long time. One of the business lines that continues to develop and record profits is its health services technology business, which combines Fujifilm’s sophisticated imaging and filmmaking technologies with the diagnostic equipment needed by the healthcare industry. Fujifilm Indonesia President Director Masato Yamamoto said quality medical technology was vital to help health workers provide examination services and diagnose diseases to make the right decisions for their patients. ""We hope that everyone can receive high-quality medical care,"" said Yamamoto. While it is primarily known for its photography equipment and services business, Fujifilm’s engagement in the healthcare industry spans nearly 90 years. The diversified conglomerate started out as a medical imaging specialist in 1936, selling X-ray film. With such a legacy, the company’s leadership is well aware of the technological advancements in film manufacturing and imaging processes, as well as the growing market demand for these technologies and related solutions. In the healthcare industry, advanced technologies are invaluable in medical diagnostic and imaging equipment. Approaching these conditions as an opportunity for further growth, Fujifilm has expanded its diagnostics business by applying artificial intelligence (AI) to its array of medical equipment, such as X-ray and ultrasound imaging, endoscopes, in vitro diagnostic systems, computerized tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as picture archiving and communication systems (PACS). According to Yamamoto, Fujifilm realizes that clinical data will be increasingly necessary to maintain health and sustain life in the future. For this reason, the company is expanding its use of AI in developing products that meet the growing needs of the healthcare industry, especially in the era following the global COVID-19 pandemic. Fujifilm has been collaborating with many parties on researching the potential development and use of AI in medicine. In April 2019, for example, Fujifilm announced that it had successfully codeveloped with Kyoto University an AI-based technology to automatically identify and measure interstitial pneumonia lesions with higher precision. The technology was developed from a Fujifilm-Kyoto University study that used AI to help diagnose patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and assess their treatment. Fujifilm's other initiatives include developing an AI platform for use in both emergency rooms and operating rooms, including for X-ray imaging during general checkups. One of the company’s visions it to provide technological support to radiographers, radiologists and surgeons during an operation. As part of its efforts to fulfill this vision, Fujifilm has developed medical systems employing medical information technology (IT) solutions that can be combined with its wide array of diagnostic and imaging products. Mammography technology Medical systems and equipment incorporating advanced technology comprise the main portfolio in Fujifilm's business transformation. In July 2019, Fujifilm launched in Japan its integrated medical software system, an AI-powered platform that employs machine learning to use the knowledge of experienced doctors in medical image analysis and diagnosis. Drawing on its industry expertise of more than 20 years and technological sophistication, Fujifilm has also developed an AI-integrated medical imaging and information management system called Synapse PACS, which is capable of managing and storing imaging data at hospitals around the world. Launched in 1999 as the first web-based PACS in the world, Synapse PACS is now used by 5,500 health facilities around the globe. Further, Fujifilm is using its imaging and processing technologies as the basis for future development of its AI technology. According to Yamamoto, Fujifilm's IT experts analyze data from the company's high-quality medical imaging solutions as in-depth learning material to produce other AI and imaging innovations. He also emphasized that one of Fujifilm's was how patients could get immediate and accurate medical treatment through diagnoses based on X-ray images, such as from chest X-rays or mammography. One of the sophisticated medical imaging equipment from Fujifilm is a high-resolution mammography, developed as part of the company’s “Never Stop” campaign, on “innovating solutions for a better world”. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of global deaths from cancer among women. Therefore, early detection of breast cancer from mammography will have a significant impact on the life expectancy and quality of life of a patient. Detecting breast cancer usually involves a doctor or oncologist advising a patient to get an X-ray examination so they can take the necessary actions. This is what happened to Anjani, a social media content specialist who was diagnosed with breast cancer. In the beginning of 2021, Anjani felt a strange lump in her right breast. She did not worry about it at the time, as she had a mammography every year and the results were always negative. However, 2020 was the one year she didn’t have a mammography because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As time passed, however, she felt that something was wrong. Finally, she saw an oncologist, who referred her to get a mammography of the breast glands and surrounding tissue to check whether the unusual growth was benign or malignant. After her mammogram was analyzed, the oncologist determined that the breast lump was malignant and that she needed oncological surgery, specifically a mastectomy to remove her right breast. Anjani's experience illustrates how a mammography can accurately locate and identify malignant cancer cells in a patient’s body. Analyzing the resulting mammogram can help doctors diagnose breast cancer and give a “second life” to their patient by determining the appropriate medical action and treatment, before it is too late. This is where Fujifilm's mammography technology comes in, by contributing to the early detection of breast cancer. Fujifilm's mammography can assist medical professionals in the early detection of anomalous tissue growth in a patient's body. They can then provide a correct and accurate diagnosis for recommending the appropriate procedure and treatment. Reducing the burden of radiation on a patient during a mammography is one of the reasons Fujifilm continues to improve its technology, by leveraging its knowledge of X-ray imaging and image processing technology it has developed for almost 90 years. ""Fujifilm continues to develop its mammography technology to monitor the slightest abnormalities in the breast. We also provide gentle digital mammography equipment with low radiation for patients,"" said Yamamoto. Among Fujifilm's most reliable technologies is its digital mammography system that uses a flat panel detector (FPD), and which can only be operated by trained professionals. This sophisticated innovation is capable of producing clear images through the use of X-ray beams at minimal radiation doses to provide high-quality images in just 15 seconds. The system uses automatic exposure control (AEC) software called i-AEC that automatically runs digital analyses on the images for each type of breast cancer. In addition, Fujifilm has innovated the Mammography QC Program, a centralized image quality and data management program that works in conjunction with its digital mammography system. The use of this tool takes only 10 minutes in a Fujifilm laboratory. The accuracy of the mammography data is fine-tuned with the help of Fujifilm FCR, the first radiographic tool in the world capable of producing high-resolution digital X-ray images. Yamamoto said Fujifilm's advanced mammography technology ensured a high level of safety for the patient, noting that the company’s unique AI technology was developed through an approach that combined human intelligence (HI) with AI. As a total healthcare company dedicated to contribute its technological know-how and experience to public health, Fujifilm offers healthcare solutions ranging from prevention to diagnosis and to treatment. Fujifilm will “Never Stop” continuing to innovate in offering solutions to create a healthier world by developing diagnostic and imaging solutions to support the work of health workers.","Fujifilm, known primarily for its photography equipment and services, has been in the healthcare industry for nearly 90 years, starting as a medical imaging specialist selling X-ray film.

"It is natural to want to provide the best for our loved ones. And the gift that keeps on giving is caring for their health in many ways, including by cooking hearty meals with nutrients that are good for their body. When cooking their family’s favorite dishes, mothers know to include Sasa Santan in their ingredients. They know that Sasa Santan is made from pure coconut milk with authentic taste and aroma and just the right thickness. But most importantly, Sasa Santan is the only healthy coconut cream in Indonesia that is fortified with Omega 3. Omega 3 is an unsaturated fatty acid that the human body cannot produce. Both are essential fats that can only be obtained from food, including fish, nuts and coconut milk. The fatty acid plays an important role in maintaining healthy blood pressure and lessening the risk of heart diseases while stabilizing heart pressure. Omega 3 is also known to manage brain function, improve memory and concentration as well as reducing the risk of developing brain-related diseases. Consuming food rich in Omega3 also helps protect the immune system as it strengthens the immune cells while also helping other cells absorb the nutrients they need. Interestingly, the Omega 3 in Sasa Santan are also claimed to make the skin healthier, hydrated and “auto-glowing” (a term to express clean, glass-like skin). But is it true? “Omega 3 is metabolized into Omega 3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA). The Omega-3 PUFA has several properties, including accelerating skin regeneration, minimizing allergic reactions on the skin and relieving skin inflammation,” said doctor and content-creator Kevin Mak. “Therefore, it’s highly important to get your Omega 3 from coconut milk derived from natural sources,” he added. Sasa Santan is derived from high-quality coconut meat, made without preservatives and containing 0 percent cholesterol. Sasa Santan is the only ready-to-use instant coconut cream with authentic taste and aroma and a texture that does not break even when cooked in high temperatures. Sasa Santan comes in 65ml and 200ml packaging size that makes it practical for direct consumption. Preparing food also becomes less of a hassle without the need to choose and squeeze a coconut yourself. With Sasa Santan on the table, all you need to do is be creative with your culinary creations! Whether it is for making rendang or opor ayam (chicken curry), Sasa Santan helps you deliver the ultimate love letter by ensuring that only the healthiest dishes are served with an infusion of the much-needed Omega 3.","Sasa Santan is a healthy coconut cream in Indonesia that is fortified with Omega 3.

"Puteri Indonesia Foundation (YPI) and Mustika Ratu are sending Indonesia’s representative to the Miss Universe 2022. Puteri Indonesia 2022 winner Laksmi Shari De Neefe Suardana will be carrying Indonesia’s name at the prestigious beauty pageant held in New Orleans, Louisiana, the United States. Laksmi will be competing with 72 finalists from other countries at the Miss Universe quarantine starting from Jan. 3 leading up to the grand finale on Jan. 14. “YPI and Mustika Ratu have done their utmost best to prepare Laksmi for Miss Universe 2022. We hope that we can bring the Miss Universe crown to Indonesia this year,” said chairperson of the advisory board for the Puteri Indonesia Foundation, Putri Kus Wisnu Wardani at the Laksmi Goes to Miss Universe press conference at the Denpasar Room, The Westin Hotel, South Jakarta, on Wednesday. “It will be a new challenge for Laksmi to promote Indonesia’s tourism and culture industry. One way is through the attire that Laksmi will be wearing during the quarantine and even the contest,” Putri added. Laksmi’s wardrobe will consist entirely of local designers and labels, including a cocktail dress by Maisonmet, an evening gown by Monica Ivena and a Balinese kebaya (traditional blouse) by Intan Avantie. She will also be decked out in a national costume themed The Glory of Phinisi by Morphacio Body Art, inspired by the Indonesian motto Jalesmeva Jayamahe, which translates to, “At sea, we are victorious”. The national costume reflects Indonesia’s historical prowess at sea and traditional maritime heritage. More importantly, it harkens back to the success of the Majapahit Empire, which is considered one of the most-powerful nations in the history of Southeast Asia. Using its naval strength, the empire was able to control sea trade and exert its influence over the region. A new era of Miss Universe Despite Laksmi and YPI’s sufficient preparation, Putri admitted they are also anticipating possible changes to the Miss Universe pageants moving forward, citing the transfer of Miss Universe’s ownership to Thai businesswoman Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip. “We are observing the new direction of Miss Universe. Seeing as the current owner of the pageant is Southeast Asian herself, we are looking forward to seeing changes in the judges’ perception of Southeast Asian and Asian contestants. But we are seeing a lot of progress over the years, with winners hailing from not just Asia, but also Africa,” she explained. Putri further commented on Indonesia gaining momentum after the recent Group of 20 Presidency’s successful run. She said that like Indonesia on the global stage, Laksmi too can deliver a message of peace and bring the world together despite the ongoing geopolitical conflict. “Be the leader [in peace]. Laksmi already fulfilled that role when she formed a WhatsApp group and invited all the other contestants -- just like President Joko [‘Jokowi’] Widodo at the G20 Summit in Bali. So, we need to be a proactive force of good for world peace too,” she added. Laksmi herself promises to not only advocate for peace and equality at the Miss Universe pageant. She also wants to introduce Indonesia and its philosophy to the world. “Indonesia is such a fascinating country, being able to unite as an archipelagic country through tolerance, understanding and local wisdom. I want [to spread] the spirit of bhineka tunggal eka, ‘unity in diversity’. That’s such an important message that we all need to remember today, especially since we’re living in such a polarized world,” she said in an interview with the media. Laksmi asked the Indonesian audience, especially pageant lovers, to support her and pray that she will achieve the best results at Miss Universe. “Not many Indonesian women receive the opportunity to represent her country on the international stage. Therefore, I ask that Indonesian people not only pray and support [us], but also demonstrate sportsmanship throughout the event,” she concluded. Laksmi was chosen as the first Puteri Indonesia from Bali in May 2022. Born in Melbourne on Jan. 29, 1996, she went on to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Fashion Business at Polimoda Florence and graduated cum laude in 2020. Laksmi was also an active participant at the Ubud Writers & Readers Festival since 2020 and Bookshelf Tour Narration Book Club 2021, with an experience as moderator for a book launch at Ubud Writers & Readers Festival 2021, and a volunteer teacher of English for Hope for Bali.","Laksmi Shari De Neefe Suardana, the winner of Puteri Indonesia 2022, will represent Indonesia at the Miss Universe 2022 pageant held in New Orleans, United States.

"International ride-hailing application inDrive has debuted its collaboration with Gardu House, a creative studio and artists management group. Bringing together six Indonesian visual artists, the partnership painted wall murals themed “#SentuhanManusia” (human touch) along the Kendal underpass, located near BNI Train Station in Central Jakarta. “Everyone is so busy rushing around, especially in a central hub like [Jakarta]. And what we wanted to highlight was the impersonal interactions between us and the apps that we use,” said Adrian Ho, creative team lead at inDrive Asia-Pacific (APAC). “So, we hope to raise the question and make people realize that the interactions they have with their apps on a daily basis is lacking that humanity, that human touch. With our app, we are trying to bring that back,” he said. What sets inDrive apart from other ride-hailing apps is that it provides an option for riders and drivers to negotiate the trip price to ensure fair and more affordable travel. Speaking to reporters at a media briefing, inDrive said it aimed to incorporate and prioritize human empathy in its application to give both riders and drivers a chance to connect, instead of just buying and selling a service. “The main difference is that inDrive is a peer-to-peer platform, rather than ride-hailing. Basically, it’s providing freedom of choice [through] peer-to-peer communication, and we are just the platform to connect the people,” explained Georgy Malkov, inDrive Indonesia country manager. The company has been operating in Indonesia since 2019 and is present in 50 cities. In addition to negotiating the price of a trip with their driver, riders are also offered optional preferences in rating drivers, setting a pickup time and selecting the vehicle model. To ensure user safety, inDrive provides a variety of security features, including the share trip feature and a safety button that connects users directly with emergency services. “The rebranding is more than just a change of color or [dropping] one letter. It comes back to refocusing our effort and drive to bring fairness to people,” Ho said, regarding the company’s recent rebranding from inDriver to inDrive. He underlined that the brand’s main mission was to create person-to-person interactions. Malkov added that inDrive had seen a significant increase in users this year. The brand’s latest collaboration with Gardu House is intended to help empower local artists, with Ho revealing that he had been following the group for some time, and that he genuinely liked their past projects. It was hoped that the six artists, by telling their stories through their murals, would remind people that they can make their own decisions, free from the shackles of digital algorithms. “[Street art] is definitely more accepted nowadays. In the past, it was an outlawed activity. But it’s about creative freedom and expression, and we support creative freedom,” continued Ho. “Our company is based on fighting injustice, drivers fighting against monopolies. Artists are very familiar with control. We want people to be free, that’s why we wanted to work with mural artists because they create elements that allow people to interact with [them].” Koma, one of the artists who appeared at the briefing, revealed that the inspiration for his art comes from the urban complexity of Jakarta, with people rushing about every day on a tight schedule. The hand in his mural symbolized technology, which restricted the freedom of people’s movement. Gardu House art director Bima Chris said the collaboration presented a new challenge for its artists, as they were only able to work for a few hours at night because of the location of the project’s site, known as one of the busiest spots in Jakarta. He added that another challenge was to find a message that aligned with inDrive’s values, as this was the Gardu House’s first time collaborating with a technology company. Bima expressed his appreciation for inDrive for inviting the group and giving them a platform to gain greater exposure. They Gardu House artists’ murals are on a partition wall, covering two previous murals commissioned by the government. The work of the six artists will be available for public viewing until Jan. 4, 2022. “You have seen the murals, that’s how we support [artists],” said Malkov. “To be honest, creative projects and activities like that is one of the first [for inDrive], but I’m not saying it should be the last. We do a lot of social projects as well besides the business itself,” he said.","inDrive, an international ride-hailing app, has partnered with Gardu House, a creative studio and artists management group, to paint murals with six Indonesian artists in the Kendal underpass in Jakarta.

"According to data from We Are Social, social media users in Indonesia grew by 12.6 percent (21 million people) between 2021 and 2022. By the start of 2022, there were 191.4 million social media users – more than half of the country’s population. With such a large user base, social media platforms are a strategic space to promote gender equality and raise campaigns to combat violence against women and children. However, very few users have the awareness or courage to do so, as well as other challenges to campaigning. Therefore, creative and strategic plans are needed from different organizations to craft a far-reaching digital campaign. Such were the findings in a baseline study done by Raise the Bar Project of Yayasan Plan International Indonesia (Plan Indonesia) in 2022. “According to the study, 92 percent of 181 respondents – most of whom were female – said they were active social media users. However, only 48 percent showed interest in participating in gender equality campaigns. Therefore, we need to encourage campaigns in the digital space, as social media platforms hold strategic value,” said Plan Indonesia executive director Dini Widiastuti during a discussion titled Social Media: A Safespace for Children and Women in Jakarta on Dec. 9. As part of the Raise the Bar project, the discussion also acted as a space to reflect, while inviting individuals and organizations to set a further agenda with the network to promote gender equality in the digital space. Involved in the discussion were Raise the Bar Project coordinator Dewi Komalasari, founder and chief editor of Konde.co Luviana Ariyanti, Indonesian Data Journalism Network (IDJN) executive director Wan Ulfa Nur Zahra and digital communications specialist at Perspectiva, Indiana “Indi” Salsabila. The algorithm challenge Algorithms play an important role on digital platforms in determining the success of the delivery of campaign messages. Algorithms may be affected by the surrounding culture and political climate, which often result in content bias and discrimination. “When campaigning for gender equality on social media, we need to be aware of the discussions and narratives currently happening in the community. It’s not just to make the campaigns more relevant, but also to enrich our perspective on the issues and ensure that algorithms can spread our message’s reach instead of covering it up,” said Indi during her presentation. The rapid stream of information and ever-changing algorithms also result in the domination of patriarchal values on the platforms. Content voicing gender equality and women leadership is often drowned out by messages that perpetuate misogyny. Therefore, Dini argued, there needed to be tactical steps in communicating on social media platforms, including by getting involved in the latest issues and stealing the audience’s attention. “Through the Raise the Bar project, we want to bring a new perspective that gender equality goes beyond being strong enough to replace the water gallon. Voicing gender equality begins with the family, starting from dividing house chores equally without basing them on gender,” she added. Collaborating with partners Raise the Bar has also collaborated with strategic partners, such as state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with their Srikandi movement and business associations such as The Indonesian Employers Association (Apindo). The project also involved key opinion leaders (KOLs) and influencers in various campaigns, as well as content creators of various sizes to create challenges to attract younger users. “Everything is designed to incite a discussion on gender equality as widely as possible. Furthermore, we also aim to shed some light on younger people’s experience when facing traditional gender norms, be it in the private domain or at work,” Dewi explained. Media, including social media, can be utilized to create content that advocate for issues such as gender equality, women’s leadership and the involvement of women in changing the mindset and behavior of their audience in a transformative way. “We need to position ourselves as listeners to women’s experiences in order to realize a society that is equal and free from gender-based violence,” said Luviana. Wan Ulfa added that data are crucial in supporting journalism as part of the campaigning efforts on social media. In addition to data, representation is essential in breathing life into a new narrative that gender equality is not meant to be negative. “If the information that’s given out is positive information, such as gender equality, it can impact users positively and the knowledge they gain will escalate into actions in real life,” she added.","According to a study done by Raise the Bar Project of Yayasan Plan International Indonesia, 92% of 181 respondents are active social media users but only 48% are interested in participating in gender equality campaigns.

Aside from reaching schools in the more remote areas of the country, LG Loves School is transitioning to providing supplies in the form of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. Previously, LG amassed most of its efforts in providing multimedia-related electronics such as computers. “The expansion of our CSR also represents our drive to support and synergize with the government in developing the competence of the Indonesian workforce,"" stated Jay. Going global with local manufacturing plants LG’s initiatives also work hand-in-hand in ensuring that Indonesia emerges as a strong production base for the domestic and international market. The factories in Cibitung (for television and monitor production) and Legok (for AC, refrigerator, washing machine production) are geared to realize this ambition. The LG Cibitung plant, for example, will be the company’s new regional center, taking two out of six production lines from Gumi, South Korea. The move is expected to improve production efficiency for LG televisions worldwide, with Gumi as a control tower for LG's other growing businesses. Established in 1995, the TV, Monitor and Digital Signage Products Production Line facility in Cibitung will be upgraded through advanced automation in assembly, quality inspection and product packaging. With the improvements, LG Cibitung is expected to increase its annual capacity by up to 50 percent. The expansion is part of LG’s bigger picture to realign production strategies to better adapt to changing market demands. An increased production capacity in Indonesia will enable LG to supply products to consumers more quickly and more efficiently than before. Last year, LG also expanded its production at the Legok plant in Tangerang, Banten, to products in the premium line. It included state-of-the-art refrigerators that added to LG’s impressive portfolio in the refrigeration and freezer segment. The Legok plant was also proud to present its more aesthetically centered line of products. This September, it introduced the LG Macaron, inspired by the delightful colors of its namesake, the famous French dessert. “Putting forward an aesthetically pleasing design with a fresh selection of colors, the LG Macaron also shows a touch of LG's signature technological innovations,” said Kris Lee, product director home appliances of LG Electronics Indonesia. The LG Macaron is available in nature beige (ivory), clay pink and clay mint. It has four cabins with the smallest capacity being 315 liters and the largest being 395 liters. Its Linear Cooling technology ensures low dynamics for changes in temperature in the cabin while Door Cooling helps keep the temperature of door racks and the surrounding area similar to the storage cabin. Meanwhile, electricity consumption is no longer a problem with an inverter compressor. LG stated that the production of the LG Macaron and its other line of refrigerators is not just meant to meet domestic demand. It also serves to answer the demand of foreign markets, even South Korea where LG is based. “Beyond providing innovative products and smart household solutions, LG also focuses on the expansion of various products as proof of our pledge to grow and develop with the people of Indonesia,” said Lee. He added that the expansion is firmly related to the growing trust of Indonesians in LG’s products and services. “Domestic production is not only related to the amount of investment in Indonesia, but also the strengthening of the faith that Indonesians have shown in us over the years,” he concluded. Moving forward, the Legok and Cibitung plants will continue to supply the Asian and Australian markets with television and monitors, as well as home appliances such as AC, refrigerators and washing machines. Meanwhile, LG will continue to expand its innovations and prepare for other ideas and initiatives that will support its mission to accompany the growth and development of Indonesia.","LG Electronics Indonesia has launched a new initiative called the LG Loves Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which includes three programs, LG Loves Green, LG Loves and Cares, and LG Loves School. The LG Loves Green program aims to plant 32,000 trees in Jakarta, Kalimantan, and Sumatra by April 2023, including 4,000 mangrove seeds on Rambut Island in Jakarta. LG also supports energy efficiency with its energy-saving appliances equipped with inverter technology and the LG ThinQ™ feature that allows homeowners to control their electronic appliances using WiFi. The company's CSR initiatives also include supporting the development of the local community, with support for the Warungasem 1 Vocational High School and expansion of its CSR to provide refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. LG's production facilities in Cibitung and Legok are geared towards establishing Indonesia as a strong production base for the domestic and international market. The Cibitung plant will be the company's new regional center, and the Legok plant has expanded its production to the premium line, including the LG Macaron, a state-of-the-art refrigerator with an aesthetically pleasing design."
"Many people consider the COVID-19 pandemic over and believe they no longer have to be on guard. However, the pandemic is still going on with a number of confirmed cases that should not be discounted. COVID-19 update Maybe you are wondering what the current COVID-19 situation is or why the virus is still around. Dr. Achmad Farchanny Tri Adryanto, the Health Ministry’s director of health surveillance and quarantine (Sukarkes) gave an update on the state of COVID-19 on Nov. 29. ""The condition of COVID-19 is still fluctuating. Although it is tending to continue to decline, new subvariants have started to appear."" ""Therefore, we are intensifying whole genome sequencing (WGS) examinations to be able to get information as early as possible and early warnings about the emergence of these new subvariants."" Whole genome sequencing is a method used to determine the genetic information of organisms, such as bacteria, humans and viruses. Apart from being able to find the causes of rare hereditary diseases, the method is used to obtain information about the virus that causes COVID-19. ""Currently, there are 13 laboratories that are able to carry out WGS examinations, and we are continuing to develop other laboratories to be able to carry out WGS examinations,"" added Farchanny. Meanwhile, whether PPKM will be cancelled in March and whether the President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo will declare the pandemic officially over is still undecided. ""We still [have to] monitor post-Christmas and New Year conditions."" Farchanny said. Christmas and New Year are times when large numbers of people go on vacation, leave their houses or return to their hometowns. People have to be cautious about the risks of COVID-19 while enjoying their time. Virus containment efforts Farchanny appealed to the public to continue to follow health protocols. ""The community must continue to carry out the health promotion program, especially wearing masks in closed public areas such as cinemas, malls and on public transportation,"" he said. COVID-19 still exists and can still be a threat to us. We should work hand in hand to break the chain of transmission so that we and those around us are protected from the virus.","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to fluctuate with new subvariants appearing. The Indonesian Health Ministry is intensifying its use of whole genome sequencing to monitor the situation.

"Diageo Indonesia and the British Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia (BritCham Indonesia) implemented the second phase of their Learning for Life program in Indonesia by holding seminars and discussion panels at the World Trade Center (WTC) on Saturday. Attended by more than 100 attendees, the speakers included leading entrepreneurs and micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) founders who were eager to share their experiences in building and growing their businesses. Attendees also had the opportunity to hear opening remarks by Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises Minister Teten Masduki, as well as Leonard Theosabrata as main director of the SMESCO Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises Marketing Service Institute (LLP-KUKM). They both reiterated the importance of MSMEs to the economy. ""The contribution of MSMEs to business development in Indonesia is very important and we must build businesses that have our own culture, our own goods that we have and when we grow up we can work together with companies and organizations such as Diageo and BritCham to enter the global market, said Leonard, citing the importance of collaborative efforts by all stakeholders. He also showed his appreciation for Diageo and BritCham and expressed his hope that the participants could optimize the knowledge gained from this training and apply it in developing their respective businesses. There are some 64.2 million MSMEs in Indonesia, the backbone of the country’s economy. In 2021, MSMEs contributed as much as 61.07 percent to the country’s GDP, which is the equivalent of around Rp 8,573.89 trillion. MSMEs also absorb 97 percent of the total existing workforce, which is estimated to be around 117 million workers. The Learning for Life seminars and training in MSME development reflect Diageo's mission to inspire and transform people's lives as one of the main purposes of the company. Director of corporate relations of Diageo Indonesia Dendy A. Borman emphasized that Diageo will continue to contribute to the communities wherever the company operates. ""Diageo has prepared a Learning for Life program and provides tools for training and skills in key areas of concern to Diageo such as the hospitality industry, retail, entrepreneurship and tourism. Learning for Life is part of the pillars of inclusivity and diversity initiated by Diageo in the Society 2030 10-year strategic plan: Spirit of Progress,” explained Dendy. “It is a pleasure to be able to support our Premier Members in this Learning for Life collaboration.

"The Finance Ministry, in collaboration with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), held an online conference on Wednesday. The event, titled “Indonesia International Conference for Sustainable Finance and Economy 2022: Sustainable Finance Toward a Transition to Net-Zero Emissions”, is expected to review policies and efforts to build a stronger Indonesian financial sector by accelerating the transition to sustainable finance in the country. The agenda is in line with the Paris Agreement, which Indonesia is party to. The country has been making progress its own way, including taking the first steps toward implementing sustainable financing, which were carried out through the launch of the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) Country Platform at the last Group of 20 side event. The ETM Country Platform will facilitate the country’s coordinating efforts to transition to cleaner energy. “Indonesia has taken real action by launching our Energy Transition Mechanism Country Platform. This is a very important milestone in designing a just and affordable energy transition for Indonesia. This CF shows that we, Indonesia, are prepared to mobilize large financial resources in the energy industry to produce dependable and inexpensive energy to sustain our robust economic growth,” said Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati. She elaborated that the platform would be utilized to bring in funding for climate change from private and public institutions. It would also generate valuable lessons for the global community in implementing better energy transition policies and create institutional and regulatory readiness for Indonesia to attract new and significant investment in its energy sector as the country simultaneously strives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Sri Mulyani added that it was up to the government to set up the legal framework and infrastructure to help Indonesia’s ESG market develop and that therefore, the platform was expected to help produce quality and affordable energy for inclusive sustainable development to achieve the net-zero emissions target for the country. Sri Mulyani continued that the government was currently trying to reform the omnibus law to further facilitate the development of the ESG market. “ICAEW’s vision is that chartered accountants enable the world of sustainable economies, with one of our strategic themes [being] to help to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. With current economic challenges and instability, and the resulting pressure of anxiety for business, it can be very easy to lose sight of the importance of the sustainability agenda and the road to net zero. But it’s critical that we maintain momentum and don't lose sight of the impact we can and must make,” said Michael Izza, chief executive of ICAEW. In September 2022, the Indonesian government issued a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), a revision to what was previously determined in the Paris Agreement. The NDC outlines that the country is committed to reducing emissions by 43.2 percent by 2030. To achieve this target, Indonesia’s ETM Country Platform will utilize a mixed financial approach, as well as international support in accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to environmentally friendly energy. “When it comes to innovative financing for SDGs and the climate crisis, I think we all agree that Indonesia has proven itself to be a pioneer. Indonesia was the first country in the world to have issued green sukuk [Sharia-compliant bonds] in 2018 and the first in ASEAN country to issue green SDG bonds in 2021. This instrument has raised more than US$6.3 billion and the funds have been used to finance green and social projects, in which UNDP is honored to be the key development partner in this undertaking,” said Muhammad Didi Hardiana, head of the innovative financing lab at UNDP Indonesia. He further stated that UNDP Indonesia was hoping to develop a new direction for aligning and engaging sustainable finance more productively for inclusive climate mitigation and adaptation. He also hoped that sustainable finance would make a real contribution to achieving the SDGs in Indonesia. To ensure the success of the ETM Country Platform, the government and other supporting organizations will also need to foster collaborative efforts with those in the mining and fossil energy sectors, as well as stakeholders in other industry sectors. Moreover, stakeholders should focus on three main things: funding for the cessation of operational high-emission power plants toward renewable energy, funding for the development of new renewable energy and human resources in an inclusive energy transition. “In 2020, we’ve become the first major professional body in the world to become carbon neutral. A master achievement which we hope inspires others to do the same. Through our own work, and through continuing to collaborate with the Finance Ministry and UNDP and others, we will help to meet the Indonesian and the global transition to a greener economy and more sustainable future,” Michael concluded.","The Indonesia International Conference for Sustainable Finance and Economy 2022 was held online by the Finance Ministry, ICAEW, and UNDP to accelerate the transition to sustainable finance in Indonesia.

"The first Starbucks Signing Store has opened its doors in Jakarta, Indonesia, dedicated to the deaf, hard of hearing, and sign language communities. The Jakarta store is the Seattle-based global coffee chain’s 17th signing store in the world. Designed with inclusivity and accessibility at its core, customers who visit the Starbucks Tata Puri Community Store at Jl. Tanjung Karang No. 3 in Kebon Melati subdistrict, Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta, will be served by deaf and hard of hearing baristas proudly wearing the green apron. Deaf baristas wear green aprons embroidered with sign language gestures spelling out “Starbucks”, while employees who can use Indonesian Sign Language, or Bahasa Isyarat Indonesia (Bisindo), wear an “I Sign” pin. Paper notepads are also available for customers to write down their beverage and food orders. The new store also offers a community area for members of the deaf community to support and conduct the programs of the Indonesian Association for the Welfare of the Deaf (Gerkatin) and the Indonesian Sign Language Center (Pusbisindo), the two organizations Starbucks has partnered with to support sign language education for the wider public in Indonesia. To encourage a culture of human connection by celebrating deaf culture and sign language, Starbucks Signing Store is also hosting sign language lessons and coffee workshops that use sign language. “The inauguration of the Signing Store is a major achievement for Starbucks Indonesia as it celebrates its 20th anniversary in the country,” said Anthony McEvoy, CEO of PT Sari Coffee Indonesia, Starbucks’ licensee partner in Indonesia. “The Signing Store demonstrates our commitment to creating a more inclusive and diverse work environment and to widening access to all communities,” McEvoy added. Anastasia Dwiyani, senior general manager human capital at PT Sari Coffee Indonesia, said the company was delighted to see the enthusiasm among the deaf and hard of hearing community during its hiring process. “More than 150 people applied from across the country. The baristas who were selected are a diverse group, including a former swimming para athlete and [a number of] fashion models,” said Anastasia. “As with all our partners [employees], we are excited to help nurture their talent and advance their career opportunities,” she added. United by sign language, the Starbucks Tata Puri Community Store is filled with design elements that bring communities together. The signature Starbucks Siren logo and Bisindo equivalent is immediately visible from the busy thoroughfare of Jl. Sudirman. The Starbucks® logo and Bisindo equivalent above the main door welcomes customers as they enter to be greeted by a wall mural and a shelf of exclusive merchandise: clear tumbler cups, stainless steel tumblers and mugs. The elongated oval community table and circle details on the floor also symbolize the store’s aim to unite communities. The most notable feature is the 4-meter-high mural painting by deaf artist Indira Natalia, which extends more than 11 meters outside the store for passersby to enjoy also, depicting the warm and welcoming Starbucks experience. “As a deaf artist, I am so proud to share my art with customers and partners at Indonesia’s first [Starbucks] Signing Store. While brainstorming, I realized that Starbucks has always strived to create an environment where everyone feels welcome and belongs, and the inspiration for my work came from that, presenting many different figures [to represent communities] united by sign language and Starbucks,” said Indira. “Art can break boundaries and unite people, just like the connection people share when they drink coffee. There are many ways to communicate and connect people from diverse backgrounds, and at Starbucks, coffee makes this happen.” Since Starbucks opened its first store in Plaza Indonesia 20 years ago, the coffee chain has expanded to 44 cities across the archipelago, with more than 4,300 employees partners now donning the green apron with pride. On its mission to make a difference in the lives of people connected with Starbucks, the company strives to create a positive impact in the communities it serves. In 2020, Starbucks opened the first Community Store in Tanah Abang to create educational opportunities for the local youth.","Starbucks has opened its 17th signing store, the Starbucks Tata Puri Community Store, in Jakarta, Indonesia.

"The Indonesian consul general in Chicago, Meri Binsar Simorangkir, gifted a batik ensemble to Atlanta Hawks NBA player Justin Holiday in Milwaukee, the United States after the match between the Atlanta Hawks and the Milwaukee Bucks. Holiday then uploaded his photos and videos wearing the batik pieces on his Instagram account @justholla7, where he appears to be very impressed by the pattern, quality and model of the clothes, which were custom-made to match his towering height of 1.98 meters. The batik ensemble is a collaboration between the Indonesian Consulate General in Chicago, batik designers Ai Syarif and Wahono, as well as Holiday, which started in November 2021. The batik is the work of one of the winners of the Indonesia-US Friendship Batik Competition entitled “The Best of Both Worlds: Batik as a Bridge Between Two Nations.” Titled Chakra Asih Pinager Lung, the batik pieces represent wisdom, love, wisdom and knowledge. The Indonesian consul general noted that the gifting of the batik was not the final objective, but rather a step to continue promoting Indonesia in the US. ""By providing batik to be worn by a well-known NBA player, the message about Indonesia will be able to reach an audience that has never been reached before,"" he said. ""We don't only want Justin Holiday to wear batik, but we also want Justin Holiday to come to Indonesia, take a vacation in Bali and also meet basketball lovers in Indonesia."" Designer Ai Syarif recounted how the batik process took place, which started when the Indonesian Consulate General in Chicago contacted him to be a judge for the batik competition. “Then, we worked together to produce batik whose motifs were Mas Wahono's creations. The process took approximately four months. After the pattern was finished, I started by making a stamp tool in Bangka Belitung. The batik was made in Lasem, Rembang,"" he said. Ai Syarif also adapted batik to Holiday's personal style, which ultimately led to the production of not a traditional shirt, but an overcoat, a bomber jacket and training pants, which were all handcrafted. Batik designer Wahono expressed his gratitude for this rare opportunity. ""I feel very honored that my batik motif can be a bridge between Indonesia and the United States’ friendship,"" he said. Meanwhile, Holiday said that he was honored and proud to wear Indonesian batik. “I'm an NBA player, so I know what it's like to have fans. But I have never received as much love as the love given by the Indonesian people,"" he said. Justin also said that going to Bali was one of his biggest desires. “It's always been on my bucket list! Because of that, one day I will definitely come to Indonesia, even participate in a basketball showcase.” Holiday also credited Rocky Padillah from Time Out Indonesia as the person who first introduced Indonesia to him. ""Rocky and the Indonesian people have treated me well, so I really want to repay and show my love and gratitude to Indonesia."" The story of the batik has also entered the radar of the Foreign Ministry, the Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry, and the Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno, all of whom have uploaded videos and photos of batik to their Instagram accounts. In addition, Ai Syarif plans to develop the batik into a capsule collection, an indication that the batik story will continue.","Indonesian Consul General in Chicago gifted NBA player Justin Holiday a custom-made batik ensemble.

"StormWall, a cybersecurity service provider that specializes in providing DDoS protection for IT infrastructures of any size and complexity, including websites, networks and online services, announced today that it was opening its sixth point of presence (PoP) in Singapore in partnership with IDCloudHost. The new PoP will operate out of the Equinix SG3 Singapore Data Center and provide robust protection against DDoS attacks for customers in the Asia-Pacific region. “We’re excited to work on this project with StormWall. StormWall's DDoS protection is one of the most advanced in the market, and we believe our partnership will go a long way toward reducing the threat of DDoS attacks in the Asia-Pacific. This is the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration,” said Alfian Pamungkas Sakawiguna, the CEO of IDCloudHost. IDCloudHost's partnership with StormWall to launch DDOS protection services is one of the Indonesian cloud server and web hosting provider’s commitments to lower the threat of cyberattacks on cloud servers in the Asia-Pacific. The new PoP allows StormWall to offer Asia-Pacific companies robust protection for website DDoS, TCP/UDP applications and networks, as well as provide web application firewall. StormWall’s proprietary Triple Filter system effectively detects spam traffic and blocks it from reaching servers without losing legitimate packets. A network bandwidth of 2500 Gbit/s sufficiently protects against even powerful botnets. “We are extremely proud of our ongoing progress. In order to provide our customers with the best protection, we are not only working on improving our AI-based traffic filtering technology, but also expanding our geographic footprint, as physical proximity to servers is critical to minimizing latency,” said Ramil Khantimirov, StormWall CEO and founder. “Of course, our point of presence in Singapore, which became possible thanks to our partnership with IDCloudHost, will help not only provide customers from the region with dependable DDoS protection, but also increase the resistance of the entire network, and for many users, sites connected to StormWall protection will load even faster than before.” StormWall’s servers in the Asia-Pacific are hosted by the Equinix SG3 Singapore Data Center, located in rooms with carefully controlled temperatures, which guarantees optimal performance at all times. Equinix is a trusted data center provider based in Silicon Valley that has been helping industry-leading organizations to interconnect since 1998. Its Singapore facility is among the most advanced in the region, and features internet exchange points with access to one of the world's three largest internet hubs in Southeast Asia to provide ultra-low latency connections. For StormWall clients, this means that switching to the protected network will cause almost imperceptible delays that will not affect their business’s normal operation, even under peak loads caused by DDoS attacks. More information on protecting against DDoS attacks is available on IDCloudHost’s dedicated webpage (idcloudhost.com/antiddos-server/). Historically, the Asia-Pacific is one of the regions most affected by DDoS attacks. In the third quarter of 2022, Singapore experienced more L3/4 DDoS attacks than anywhere else in the world. China is the third most attacked country, and Taiwan has also seen heavy DDoS activity. DDoS attacks are a constant threat for any online business. Studies show that around 70 percent of organizations have been targeted by such attacks in the last 12 months. A successful attack can be a company’s worst nightmare, as it can paralyze a company’s entire internet infrastructure. Bad actors use DDoS attacks to demand ransom from targeted companies, as downtime leads to losses as well as heavily impacts a company’s reputation, followed by costly recovery.","StormWall, a cybersecurity provider, has partnered with IDCloudHost to open its 6th PoP in Singapore.

At the end of November, the Singapore brokerage company had acquired 74.1 million shares of TECH, equivalent to 5.9 percent ownership. PT Indosterling Technomedia TBK (TECH) is majority owned by PT Indosterling Sarana Investa, led by Sean William Henley. Sean William Henley, chairman of TECH, affirmed that DBS’ investment indicated a high level of confidence in the future of TECH despite the threat of global recession and a wave of layoffs in sight. “TECH is arguably not a typical-startup company. We are still growing amid the general weakness observed in other technology companies,” said William Henley at PT Indosterling Technomedia Tbk (TECH) public expose in Jakarta, on Wednesday (30/11). Several technology companies have failed in the last six months. He admits TECH’s main strength lies in TECH products, which focus on business-to-business (B2B) as the backbone. Most startups are highly dependent on investor funds in order to survive, while TECH B2B products were successfully absorbed by the market. Billy Andrian, CEO of TECH, is optimistic about conditions in the future with the company's assets and equity increasing compared to last year. “We believe 2022 will be closed with a positive performance and even better results next year.” He mentioned the post-COVID-19 national economic-recovery process has affected various sectors, especially the technology sector. In the public expose, the explanation was done for subsidiaries under TECH, which consists of Edufecta (PT Technomedia Interkom Cemerlang), an integrated campus-management system and KAWN (PT Technomedia Sarana Semesta) food-and-beverages point-of-sales system. Yoas, director of Technomedia Multi Sejahtera (KAWN), stated KAWN had successfully integrated the BCA EDC system with a QR-code system and was in the process of integrating with Accurate, one of the largest accounting-system providers in Indonesia. “The collaboration with BCA will add KAWN value to users, in line with the massive adoption of QR payment. Besides, KAWN has collaborated with Accurate to develop an integrated-accounting system.” The stable and dynamic performance of TECH's shares in local-exchange trading has won it inclusion in the S&P Emerging BMI Index so that State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) trades TECH in the form of US$2 billion group ETFs (SPEM) and groups under $2 billion (EWX). ETF is a type of mutual fund whose performance refers to a certain index and is traded like a stock on an exchange whose movements can be observed. SSGA is the investment-management division of State Street Corporation, which is the fourth-largest asset manager in the world. In the end of 2021, SSGA managed nearly $4.14 trillion in assets.","DBS Vickers Securities has invested in PT Indosterling Technomedia Tbk (TECH) despite the downward trend in Indonesia's technology sector.

Drawing on his years of experience, which entails collaborations with major fashion labels like Louis Vuitton and Issey Miyake alongside musicians like Pharrell Williams and Kanye West, Murakami said that Asian creators should find the courage to break into the global scene while also not being afraid to learn Western influences. At the same time, artists should find out what originality sets them apart from the rest, while also actively promoting themselves through popular endeavors, from social media to NFTs.","Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami expressed his appreciation for the Indonesian art scene and named Bandung-based artist Machine 56 as one of his favorite artists.

"On Tuesday, Syngenta Seeds Indonesia (Syngenta) announced the inauguration of new plant equipment, including a corn-seed grain dryer, parent seeds post-harvest operation (PS PHO) and single-pass reversible dryer at its Pasuruan facility. Syngenta also opened an official e-commerce store for distributing NK Corn Seed products. The two-day inauguration event was attended by around 1,000 corn farmers whom Syngenta is committed to support via a variety of innovations, opening new opportunities in agriculture. The previous day, Syngenta also held an expo in Jombang, East Java, and launched the NK Naga superior-corn seed. Also present at the event were Justin Wolfe, president of Syngenta Seeds; Bill Tomlinson, head of global-seeds production and supply; Kazim Hasnain, president director of Syngenta Indonesia; Fauzi Tubat, seed-business head of Syngenta Indonesia; Ir. Suwandi, director general of Food Crops represented by Catur Setiawan, coordinator of Seed Quality Control Directorate General of Food Crops; and local government officials and partners. “I am happy to meet directly with Indonesian farmers and listen to their challenges. It will help Syngenta in understanding their challenges better while supporting their endeavor to fulfill the need for Indonesian food self-sufficiency,” said Justin Wolfe. Efforts to improve the farmers’ productivity start with selecting tested superior seeds and ensuring their availability. With a new grain dryer, the Pasuruan seed-production center can improve the capacity of its cob-drying machines. The drying process of parent seeds with the support of PS PHO has a greater capacity, while maintaining the germplasm. Then, the single-part reversible dryer improves the overall system with doubled-production capacity. E-commerce is another indispensable part of the supply chain. The opening of Syngenta’s online shop will help more farmers -- especially those who are digitally transformed -- to obtain their NK Corn Seed products. “This official e-commerce store will be available on various marketplaces, such as Shopee, Lazada and Tokopedia. It will support farmers, especially for those who have difficulty reaching conventional shops, to get the best seeds for their cultivating corn,” added Fauzi Tubat. “Syngenta’s superior corn seeds have long been known by Indonesian farmers and are proven to increase corn productivity,” Hasnain added optimistically. Currently, Indonesia sits at the top of corn production in ASEAN with a total planted area of 3.5 million hectares (ha) and a land productivity of 5.4 tonnes per ha. The majority of corn farmers are smallholder farmers with an average land area of ​​0.5 ha. For more than 20 years, Syngenta has been providing corn farmers with high-grade seeds and innovations to increase their land productivity. NK Naga superior corn seeds Indonesian farmers are highly familiar with seeds produced by Syngenta, including NK 212, NK Perkasa, NK Sumo, NK Andalan, NK Juara, NK Super, NK Garuda and NK Fantastis. The recently launched NK Naga variant is able to adapt to paddy fields previously used for rice and corn planting using rainwater as an irrigation system. NK Naga’s can be planted on lands that have been negatively affected by various endemic biota such as downy mildew and bacterial-stalk rot. The highly disease-resistant seeds are also very profitable as they can be planted more densely. All of its properties make NK Naga the best solution for farmers to gain optimal harvest yields.","Syngenta Seeds Indonesia has inaugurated new plant equipment, including a corn-seed grain dryer, post-harvest operation and single-pass reversible dryer at its Pasuruan facility.

"The star-studded IdeaFest 2022 charmed the Indonesian audience from Nov. 24 to 27 at the Jakarta Convention Center (JCC) with inspirational talks from a diverse panel of speakers, from entrepreneurs to activists. Among the speakers were a number of government officials, who shared some words of advice that transcended the audience’s political preferences. Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, speaking at a session titled Leadership in a Polarized World on Nov. 25, highlighted important issues that will be faced by the coming generations, including food, energy and water security as well as climate change. “Thankfully, we have the [foreign policy] tradition of bebas aktif [free and active], where a thousand allies are too few and one enemy is too many. That is the wisdom I received from our founding fathers, and what we will pass on to our successors,” he said. Prabowo also emphasized a need for peace in the pursuit of prosperity, cautioning future leaders against acquiescing to the few over the needs of the people. Meanwhile, Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno highlighted the creative industry’s burgeoning potential, noting that Indonesia’s creative economy is the third-largest contributor to the national economy. He also noted the three qualities needed to succeed in the increasingly competitive creative industry: innovation, adaptability and collaboration. “With adaptation, we must be able to readily adapt to current situations and conditions as well as being more attuned to the changes that are happening. If we can’t adapt and become complacent, it’s going to be hard for us to grow.” In terms of collaboration, Sandiaga cautioned against excessive pride, as everyone will always have their own weaknesses. These weaknesses, he continues, can be minimized or covered up through collaboration with fellow creative-industry players. Sandiaga’s predecessor, former Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Wishnutama reminded the younger generation to properly appreciate their time, noting that even the richest and most powerful cannot turn back time. “The richest person can’t buy back the time that has gone past, the most powerful cannot go back in time, and the smartest do not have the capability to go back even one minute,” he said. “Sadly, we often let time pass. ‘I’ll do it later’ is often what happens even though we know we’ll miss our chances, and then we’ll think about how we should have done this and that.” According to Wihnutama, he himself does not regret the time that has passed, as he knows he has done his best. “I know at that time that I have done my best. I did not dither, and I did not let my time go to waste.”","Indonesian officials and creative industry leaders spoke at the 2022 IdeaFest held at the Jakarta Convention Center from Nov. 24-27.

"PT Vale Indonesia Tbk. and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co. officially commemorated the start of the development of their Pomalaa Block project in Koloka on Sunday (27/11/2022). The South Sulawesi project will operate under PT Kolaka Nickel Indonesia (KNI), with a total investment package of Rp 67.5 trillion (US$4.29 billion) for high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) processing and the mine. It is expected to generate roughly 12,000 construction jobs in the area. “Today’s groundbreaking is a major stepping stone that positions PT Vale to supply sustainable and responsibly sourced nickel well into the future. We believe Indonesia has a critical role to play in the global electrification and decarbonization mega-trends, with the potential to become the most sustainable nickel producer in Asia with the highest environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. We are committed to playing an active role in this journey,” said Eduardo Bartolomeo, CEO of Vale, who was present at the event. The HPAL Pomalaa project is expected to be one of the largest nickel smelters in the world and was inaugurated by Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Pandjaitan. He attended the event alongside Southeast Sulawesi Governor Ali Mazi and Kolaka Regent Ahmad Safei. Deshnee Naidoo, PT Vale president commissioner, noted Indonesia’s potential to be a key player in the global energy transition, adding that the ceremony gave everyone a glimpse of the future Indonesia was working toward. “We are proud to begin the development of the Pomalaa block, which will be a crucial part of Indonesia’s efforts to accelerate downstream nickel production. This project is critical to our growth agenda and marks the newest chapter in PT Vale’s 54-year contribution to Indonesia,” said Febriany Eddy, CEO of PT Vale. She reiterated that the project would not be powered by coal, in line with PT Vale and Huayou’s core values and ESG standards. The Pomalaa project has been designated as a National Strategic Project using Huayou’s HPAL technology to generate up to 120,000 tonnes of nickel per year. It is targeted to produce mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP), which is generally used to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles. It is hoped that the Pomalaa HPAL Block and its products will continue PT Vale’s commitment to contributing to global and Indonesian electrification and decarbonization initiatives, as well as advancing the country’s manifestation to be a major player in the electronic vehicle (EV) industry. “We support PT Vale Indonesia. We are excited for this project, which will support downstream economic development of the nickel industry within the province. It is also a project that aligns with the government’s economic priorities and program to reduce carbon emissions,” concluded Governor Ali.","PT Vale Indonesia Tbk and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co have started the development of their Pomalaa Block project in South Sulawesi, Indonesia.

"The Future of Work & Education Taskforce (FOWE TF) is playing a pivotal role in the B20 as the team that will decide the future of the workforce and education. The maximization of future job opportunities cannot be separated from the education system. Therefore, the taskforce has prepared three policy recommendations to close the education gap in member countries and alleviate unemployment; supporting post-pandemic recovery and growth, upgrading education and lifelong learning and ensuring workforce inclusion. Over the past years, the educational gap between countries and social backgrounds have been magnified by rapid technology innovations and automation. Chair of the FOWE TF, Hamdhani D. Salim, stated that the pandemic provided lessons for all of us, to reassess the relevance of the world of education today. An education system that is aimed toward the future needs of industry should encourage lifelong learning. The pandemic caused the normalization of distance learning. While technology is instrumental in ensuring that the education sector continues during restrictions, equitable use of technology is still a global problem. Unprepared infrastructure, limited learning infrastructure based on digital technology and literacy issues in the education sector were the policy priorities brought to the attention of the taskforce. Giving a speech regarding the B20-G20 Dialogue to students in August, chair of B20, Shinta Kamdani, revealed more obstacles for education and future job opportunities. Firstly, a World Economic Forum report estimates that by 2025 85 million jobs may be displaced by machines, but 97 million new roles may emerge due to a new dynamic between people and technology. “The second problem is about the gap in science, technology, engineering and mathematics [STEM] literacy knowledge between developed and developing countries. In fact, this is the key in facing a future that is currently driven by science and technology, especially digitalization. If we don't find a solution soon, a large part of the world's population will lose the opportunity to participate in the global job market,” explained Shinta. Moreover, the third obstacle is gender discrimination. Data reveal that more than 16 million girls do not have access to education, while women have shown tremendous potential talent in the workforce, which has contributed to the global economic recovery. To tackle this specific problem, Shinta introduced One Global Women Empowerment (OGWE), an initiative that focuses on digital literacy and women's leadership skills, as well as creating a safe and fair work environment. In Indonesia Presidential Regulation (Perpres) No. 68/2022 highlights the need for revitalization for vocational education and vocational training. According to Iwan Syahril, director general of teachers and education personnel at the Education Ministry, the work landscape had transformed long before the pandemic. He is currently encouraging students to do internships in industry so that they have experience, skills and knowledge about the world of work, which largely relies on collaboration between educational institutions and industry. ""Organizationally, the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is involved to be able to make improvements in vocational education, including aligning vocational education and training so that the workforce has the competencies needed by the business world and in the end can reduce unemployment,"" said Arsjad Rasjid, chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN). At another FOTW TF side event in June, president director of Komatsu Indonesia Pratjojo Dewo Sridadi also agreed that training and vocational education through internships, especially industrial apprenticeship programs, can smooth the transition from the world of training and education to the world of work. Responding to the needs of industry, he said that link and match was the key to the success of vocational education through synchronizing curriculum and teaching materials on campus according to industry needs, practical practice and hands-on learning.","The Future of Work & Education Taskforce (FOWE TF) in the B20 is responsible for determining the future of the workforce and education. They have made three recommendations to address the education gap and unemployment in member countries: supporting post-pandemic recovery and growth, upgrading education and lifelong learning, and ensuring workforce inclusion.

However, there are obstacles such as the digital divide, STEM literacy gap, and gender discrimination that need to be addressed. In Indonesia, the government has emphasized the revitalization of vocational education and training through industry collaboration. The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is involved in improving vocational education to ensure the workforce has the required competencies. Internships and industrial apprenticeship programs are seen as effective in bridging the gap between education and the world of work. The key to success is to align curriculum and teaching materials with industry needs and provide hands-on learning opportunities."
"Bali has long been a magnet for digital nomads. Canggu and Ubud areas are always among the top destinations on the radar and are recommended as nomad destinations. According to the Nomadlist index, a site that ranks cities in the world that are chosen as places for nomads, apart from the relatively low cost of living, these two areas are also considered feasible and comfortable remote workplaces because of the high-speed internet, safe environment and local friendliness to foreigners. The Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry (Menparekraf) responded to this fact. Parekraf Minister Sandiaga Uno targets Bali as a place to work and for vacation or workcation for digital nomads (remote workers). By making Bali top of mind or the top choice for foreign tourists, workcations for digital nomads will create a long and quality length of stay. The ease of facilitating work visas and visas related to digital nomad activities is a priority that the Menparekraf is pushing. Digital nomads generally prefer to linger in one place to enjoy the nature and culture of the local community. Compared to regular tourists, digital nomads spend a long time in one destination. Therefore, an important thing that needs to be considered is the choice of place to live for digital nomads. There are many options to stay in Bali, from inns to five-star hotels. However, the facilities and comfort of star hotels are at odds with the economic considerations of digital nomads. In this case, the villa appears as an alternative destination for digital nomads to live in. However, most villa tenants prefer relatively long rental duration, mostly yearly or even longer. To address this challenge, Villa Rentals in Bali (VRiB) offers an alternative solution in the form of a web-based villa rental platform that provides flexibility in the duration of rentals up to daily periods by subsidizing the course of rentals with a longer range according to the wishes of the property owner. “We realize that many expatriates in Indonesia, including digital nomads, do not have a sufficient understanding regarding the general practice of property leasing, especially in Bali. They have concerns about making large advance transfers for long-term villa rentals due to their limited understanding of Indonesian law,” said Bence Schmatovich, initiator of VRiB. It is hoped that in the future, the obstacles that VRiB can bridge will increase the interest of expatriates or digital nomads to continue choosing Bali as the main destination in their planned workcation activities.","Bali has become a popular destination for digital nomads. Canggu and Ubud areas are favored for their low cost of living, high-speed internet, safe environment, and local friendliness. The Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry (Menparekraf) wants to promote Bali as a work and vacation destination for digital nomads. The Ministry is making it a priority to ease the process of obtaining work visas and visas related to digital nomad activities. Digital nomads tend to stay in one place for an extended period to experience local culture and nature. To accommodate this, villas can be a good alternative to hotels but with the challenge of long-term rental options. VRiB, a web-based villa rental platform, offers flexible rental periods up to daily, helping to address this challenge. VRiB's goal is to remove obstacles for expatriates and digital nomads in choosing Bali as their workcation destination."

In line with the artist’s efforts to observe human behavior while immersed in various forms of entertainment and daily activities, Flash, Pow, Bham! highlights the ingrained relationship between everyday life and the entertainment world, interpreted as something that is both interactive and full of surprises. Naufal’s signature artistic style combines painting and comedic elements, such as his distinctive penchant for including the phrase ""haha"", which is evident in several of his paintings. The Indonesian-born artist have made his existence known worldwide, as some of his art has been sold to collectors in Spain, France, Singapore and South Africa.

"Hard Rock Hotel Bali announced its most recent action toward fostering sustainable tourism with the installation of cutting-edge glass bottling technology for drinking water. The project, launched on Jan. 9, aims to reduce the hotel’s carbon footprint and remove single-use plastic bottles, beginning with the replacement of plastic water bottles with sealed glass bottles in all 418 guest rooms and suites. In addition to routine laboratory testing, the water bottling plant delivers the finest filtration capable of removing bacteria, particles and other contaminants through reverse osmosis and UV sterilization, ensuring the quality of the drinking water while maintaining the highest standard of safety and hygiene. In Bali and many parts of the world, the vast majority of plastic bottles end up in landfills and the ocean, or are burned, generating air pollution detrimental to human health and the environment. With the automated water-bottling plant in house, Hard Rock Hotel Bali is able to eliminate more than 400,000 plastic bottles every year, as well as reduce the carbon emissions associated with transporting the plastic bottled water. The initiative will also extend to include restaurants and other facilities within the hotel.","Hard Rock Hotel Bali has installed a new glass bottling technology for drinking water to reduce its carbon footprint and eliminate single-use plastic bottles.

On the second day, the delegates visited the Social Welfare Center Plaza in Kitakyushu city, which is equipped with various smart assistive devices for people with disabilities such as smart beds, robotic pets, laptops with eye and movement sensors, and various robotic wheelchairs equipped with artificial intelligence (AI).

Ambassador Heri emphasized his commitment to strengthening the Social Affairs Ministry’s programs and policies under the leadership of Social Affairs Minister Risma. One of the commitments of the Indonesian Embassy in Japan is to purchase and market batik products produced by persons with disabilities assisted by the Social Affairs Ministry centers. ""Batik products made by persons with disabilities who are assisted by the Social Affairs Ministry’s centers are very good in quality. We are ready to buy and market them,"" said Heri. Harry expressed his hope that the Indonesian Embassy could provide convenience and serve as a bridge between the ministry and the Japanese government in following-up the process should the cooperation be formed in the future.

The Japanese government has created a support system in local government, opening a shelter as a rehabilitation and protection service, while also strengthening the care system. The second day was also spent at the JCSW, where the delegation was briefed on services for persons with disabilities that are based on strong regulations. State obligations are realized by providing medical care, education, career counselling and career promotion, along with providing insurance for persons with disabilities.

"After a two-year pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the most comprehensive international exhibition of toys, baby and maternity products, electronics, smart appliances and household supplies will again be held offline at the Jakarta International Expo (JIEXPO) from Nov. 23-25, 2022. The three B2B exhibitions, International Baby Products and Toys Exhibition (IBTE), Indonesia International Electronics & Smart Appliances (IEAE) and the Indonesia International Gift & Houseware Expo (IGHE) are the best place for businesses in the industries to gather and reach more markets. Some 150 companies from three Asian countries will participate at JIEXPO this year. Each booth will showcase various products and innovations that reflect their advanced production technology. “The Indonesian government’s participation in this digital transformation provides an indirect contribution to [the toys, electronics and household products industry]. The first quarter of 2022 saw growth of 6.8 percent,” said the Information and Communication Technology Business (APTIKNAS) chairman, Soegiharto Santoso. Specifically, the baby products and toy industry is slowly finding renewed vigor following the slowdown of the pandemic. Today, the Indonesian baby products and toymaker scene is ready to compete in the global market by keeping up with existing trends and the latest technologies. But the pandemic also taught the toy industry a lesson, according to Indonesian Toy Association chairman Sutjiadi Lukas. “The online school policy is also a supporting factor in the recovery of the toy industry. More children have been spending time at home, so they need more toys to help them pass the time. We start from traditional toys to educational sets and finally digital ones,” added Sutjiadi. “With the IBTE, IEAE and IGHE 2022 held in one venue, we are optimistic that this demonstrative expo will bring about positive change in the industries involved —and will hopefully take part in the national economic recovery,” said project director, Paul Kingsen. The IBTE, IEAE and IGHE 2022 are open free of charge from 10 a.m – 6 p.m. Visitors can pre-register by signing up at ibte.co.id or ieae.co.id.","The International Baby Products and Toys Exhibition (IBTE), Indonesia International Electronics & Smart Appliances (IEAE), and the Indonesia International Gift & Houseware Expo (IGHE) will take place at the Jakarta International Expo from Nov. 23-25, 2022.
